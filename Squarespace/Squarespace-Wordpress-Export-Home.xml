      <title>A Lesson in Wifery</title>
      <link>/home/a-lesson-in-wifery</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love Esther’s story. When I was a child we watched “Children’s Heroes of the Bible” (Great Stories, Bible Stories). The Story of Esther was my favorite and even in that cruddy old animation, I appreciated her beauty and her gentleness. I don’t know what exactly drew me into that story. I was such a tomboy and had no interest in princesses. I was an absolutely fearless child (to a fault) and didn’t relate at all to her timidity. But I delighted every time Esther’s story came on.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Not too long ago, our Bible curriculum got around to the Book of Esther and I was so excited to tell her story to my kiddos. They all stared at me, almost in shock over my own cruddy old animation in which I told the story! They laughed at me and so I made them watch the old cartoon story as a punishment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I do love Esther.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today I love Esther even more because she was a good wife. A God-honoring wife. A wife that would have most modern feminists in absolute fits.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

      <title>A Method of Bible Study</title>
      <link>/home/a-method-of-bible-study</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think Christians go through steps of Bible study in their walk. At first, reading God’s Word is very personal: “What does this mean to me?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The next step is more selfless: “What does this mean for others: for the lost?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Problems come from staying in either of these mindsets, though. The Christian looking to interpret the Bible through the lense of self-discovery will often begin to use personal Bible study time as sort of a fortune cookie reveal, or daily horoscope reading. I once listened to a mother tell of a time when she struggled with her children and she opened her Bible and read what was there. “Let them go,” it said.  And so she did. She let go of the reins when they were very young and, like saplings in a windstorm, they broke. One by one, we watched these children fall. It was and is heartbreaking to see.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But one might, and often does, grow out of reading themselves into the text. Then they start to read the text for the sake of the lost. This is the <em>greater good</em>, isn’t it? I remember a time in my walk when I was convinced that all things happened for the lost, that God sustained all of life for the sake of even one more soul won for Him. It seems altruistic, right? To take ourselves out of the equation and put all of our efforts into saving the lost. But when we do this, our focus, although it’s not on ourselves, is still not on God. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember reading the beginning of Andy Stanley’s book, Irresistible, and he talked about some young girl who had just learned of Christ and was so overwhelmed with joy, but then she asked the fateful question: why isn’t everyone a Christian? The news was so good to her and she didn’t understand why anyone would not be happy to hear of Christ and then accept him eagerly. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This book was being passed around and praised in our church and I couldn’t get past the introduction! Sinners’ hearts are not inclined toward God! The whole premise of the book and the subsequent doctrine it taught was based on a denial of that fundamental truth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we turn our ears and our hearts to the lost, we are suddenly at the mercy of a people that hate God. We want to reconcile unbelievers to God on their terms, which makes reading the Bible very difficult, much less preaching it. We want so badly to save the lost that we turn our backs on the very God we are trying to save them for.  Suddenly we are turning less and less to God’s word for how to do things and instead we are asking what the current culture wants. We are preaching acceptance and love, instead of sin and repentance, and literally “unhitching” from the word of God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Personal Bible study with a heart focused on convincing unbelievers of God’s goodness makes us squirm through most of the Bible. They wouldn’t like what it says here, here, and here! We become apologetic and avoid most of what God has to say.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now this brings us to another problem: how do we hear from God when we won’t read His Word? Now we are relying on a God who speaks directly to us, and I suppose the more confidently and frequently we can say “God told me…” the holier we are. And, if you’re very charismatic, or at least very convincing, this is a great way to start a cult. ;)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have to outgrow these Bible study methods! It is a shame to see so many adult Christians stuck here. It is a tragedy to see so many preachers stuck here -in either of these two mindsets!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Instead, look to study God’s Word with the objective of knowing God. When we do that, we will easily see that God loves. He loves His people. He knows us individually, intimately: knitting us in the womb and knowing even the number of hairs on our head! He finds His sheep, and not one will be lost. I say those first because we don’t have to feel like turning our focus toward God means we are turning our back on the lost or ourselves. It is much better to let God direct our way to reach the lost than it is to try to figure it out on our own. It is much better to learn how we should live by faith through the direction of God’s word than it is to go by how we <em>feel</em> we should live. God takes care of us better than we can take care of ourselves.  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we study God’s Word to know Him, with the belief that He is good and just and all-knowing, we will not be ashamed or apologetic of what we read. We will not make excuses or compromise His commands to appease others. We will not make life-altering decisions based on one verse taken out of context. Rather, we will learn to apply the whole counsel of God to our lives. We will be driven daily to His Word to know him more. </p>

      <title>A Change of Heart</title>
      <link>/home/a-starting-point</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I never liked kids. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I never wanted to have children. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a matter of fact, I remember doing pre-marital counseling. One thing me and my then soon-to-be husband were asked to consider was if we were on the same page regarding children. We both agreed that we were, and we confirmed that we didn’t want any.  Maybe 1, but that was doubtful. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is the God who changes hearts. </p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.</em> Ezekiel 36:26 </h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We now have 4 kids and we both mourn the decision to take permanent steps to keep it at 4.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I was in college, my friend and I went to the state fair. A small child started following me. He was only watching the legs at his eye level and so he thought he was following his mother. I knew that when he looked up, he was going to freak out and my thought process was something like, “He’s going to scream; people are going to look; people are going to think I am trying to kidnap this kid!” Rather than try to find the mother or dismantle the kid-bomb I knew was about to explode, I stopped moving, threw my hands in the air, and started assuring everyone that I wasn’t trying to steal the kid. “He’s not mine!” Everyone, including the kid, looked at me like I was crazy. Luckily, my friend was more nurturing. She calmly laughed and talked to the young lad and quickly found his mother. She had been following right behind him, waiting for him to notice that he had mindlessly followed a crazy stranger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Around the same time, I was actually watching a friend’s toddler during the day. I wanted to help her out, but I really didn’t like the whole kid-watching gig. One day I was complaining to my sister over the phone about it, trying to come up with a way to get out of my commitment. Her recommendation was that I pray and ask God to change my heart. I was so furious at this answer! I didn’t want my heart to change; I wanted my circumstance to change! I was so angry that I hung up on her. I’m pretty sure this was a phone you could slam down to hang up; at least, that’s how I remember it!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But now here I am - a church preschool minister with a passion for godly, fruitful families.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is the God who changes hearts.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be given to him; and let seven periods of time pass over him. </em>Daniel 4:16</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t know why, but God changed my heart. I say that I don’t know why because I never asked Him to. But every day I am so unbelievably grateful because whatever His plan is has something to do with me or my kids  - because He changed my heart against my own stubborn will! </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Who am I that I should benefit from His plan? I am chief of the sinners and least of the saints. I look around and I see that He isn’t doing that for everyone. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Who am I? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He has given so many others over to their lust and desires, but He changed my heart. </p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. </em>Deuteronomy 30:6</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love my God and I will seek His will and serve Him with very little regard for man’s wisdom because I know that man’s ways lead to destruction, and I know that He pulled me off that path without my asking. I see the goodness of God’s ways and I see the folly of my own.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t change anyone’s heart and hearing what I have to say from time to time might make you want to slam a phone in my ear to shut me up, but I pray that God does change your heart and that you too will get to taste and see that the Lord – and His ways – are good!</p>

      <title>“But what do you DO?”</title>
      <link>/home/but-what-do-you-do</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was once asked what I did - what my job was. “I’m a wife and mother.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But what do you DO?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The question wasn’t a curious look into what a wife and mother does; it was a condescending reminder that I would need to do more to be a valuable contributor to my family. The question was essentially,  “What do you do, as in for work…. as in, for <em>worth</em>.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The role of ‘wife and mother’ has been so devalued in our culture, that neither wife nor mother is apparently a job that actually needs to be done anymore; it’s just a bunch of tasks that can be outsourced. We love to outsource things, don’t we! Anything that can be done by someone else, well, I suppose it should, right? Anything mundane can be taken care of by a robot or a drive-thru and anything requiring skill or patience is really best left to the “experts.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Teachers teach. Preachers preach. Doctors diagnose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over the last (nearly) century, we have really seen a shift from “jack of all trades” to “that’s not in my wheelhouse.” We once had the “village” to help moms overcome the knowledge gaps: how do I correct this, teach that, cook this, and diagnose that? We just don’t have that anymore. It seems like it should be easier to have a village because of how easily we can connect through technology, but the wisdom has been forgotten. Trying to do for yourself what the masses have outsourced is generally perceived as foolishness and you’ll likely get more ridicule than help.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One Christmas, my kids and husband had the flu. (Not mom – moms don’t get the flu!) We didn’t go to the doctor. We recognized the symptoms, monitored the fevers and insisted on plenty of fluids. “But how do you know it’s the flu?” people would ask. It was as though I wasn’t allowed to give a diagnosis or treatment without a doctor’s consent. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Who gave you the authority to <em>not </em>go to the doctor?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am not at all saying doctors are bad or should be avoided, but I am saying we have crossed a line in outsourcing nearly all matters of home and family. For all the knowledge and information we have at our fingertips, I am amazed at how it only seems to count if it is a specialized knowledge, proven by a paycheck.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Check your heart on this one. It’s not just that mothers can do the things we’ve been outsourcing, it’s that we should! ‘Wife and Mother’ is a wonderful, God-given job! This calling is the rule, not the exception. Even the Christian family has gotten this one backwards. Most moms now think staying home is a special call, when in fact, we should be treating working outside the home as a special call. God has specifically chosen you to be the mother to your own children, the wife to your own husband. The decision to work outside the home, requiring the education and the care of the household to be outsourced, should be made with the same care and concern as a missionary would make before moving overseas. It should be prayerfully considered and confirmed by the husband and church.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>The&nbsp;heart&nbsp;is&nbsp;deceitful&nbsp;above&nbsp;all&nbsp;things, and&nbsp;desperately&nbsp;sick; who&nbsp;can&nbsp;understand&nbsp;it? </em>Jeremiah 17:9</h4>

      <title>But Why?</title>
      <link>/home/but-why</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Now this is the commandment—the statutes and the rules—that the LORD your God commanded me to teach you, that you may do them in the land to which you are going over, to possess it, that you may fear the LORD your God, you and your son and your son’s son, by keeping all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be long. Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. (Deuteronomy 6:1–3)</em></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The wonder and curiosity of small children is truly something to be envied. Everything in this world is new and exciting and their knowledge is growing every day. Of course, for parents, our children’s constant curiosity might just be the most annoying thing, too! With curiosity comes questions. Lots of questions. Why is the sky blue? Why do we have to go to sleep? Why do dogs have fur? Why do I have to do schoolwork? But Why?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But why? But why? But why?!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over time, even simple questions can wear us down. They can try our patience even when we know every answer. And most of the time, their questions are simple and easy to answer. We get to look like scientific gen and our answers can make us look like geniuses to our children, but they can also expose huge gaps in our own knowledge. It’s definitely worth taking the time to find the answers we don’t know, both for the benefit of our children and ourselves. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is more than true when those curious minds start probing around in regards to our Christian faith and the practice of it. Consider <strong>1 Peter 3:15</strong>:</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>But in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect</em></span></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We often use this verse for Christian Apologetics. As a matter of fact, the word translated to “defense” is the Greek word from which we get “apologetics.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many Christians will dismiss learning the harder, less obvious truths of the Bible because they are not the confrontational type of person and so they don’t see themselves as the ones to argue with strangers in the city square about life, death, creation, destruction, etc.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Don’t limit this command to be prepared to give a defense solely to strangers. Consider the importance of apologetics in the home. When your children ask questions, everything eventually goes back to the Creator. And when you start building foundations on biblical truth, the biblical questions will start pouring in. And while you might find it an easy pass to answer a stranger with “I don’t know,” it looks a lot more like disobedience when we shrug off our own children’s curiosity.</p><h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Educate, don’t re-educate. </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In just as recently as 1990, 85% of American adults identified themselves as Christian.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In 2020 that percentage was down to 65%. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Clearly, the ball has been dropped. Christian tradition is not being carried to the next generation. Much of Christian apologetics in our own country occurs between a believer and someone who is familiar with Christianity. The conversation is not typically with people that merely have an innocent interest in a foreign religion. Instead, these “apologetic” dialogues are with children or grandchildren of people that had claimed Christianity. These children and grandchildren have had some exposure to Christianity but have rejected it and now require a defense from a mostly hostile position.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is a heartbreaking statistic, but we should note it, learn from it, and look forward. How do we reverse the numbers? How do Christian parents teach children to know and love the Lord? How can we get it right when they're young so that they don't become hostile to the truth?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tell them <em>Why</em>. Be prepared to make your defense.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s funny how all roads seem to go back to the Bible. Read it. Meditate on it. Learn from sound preachers. Don’t let a single question pass you by without taking advantage of the opportunity to dig in. Equip yourself and your family with a rich intimacy with God’s Word. Let their curiosity spur on your own sanctification.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a woman and mother, I can find no job or calling higher than this one!</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel. (Judges 2:10)</em></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We might be doing well to tell our kids The 10 Commandments, but without <em>Why</em>, there’s often not enough to fuel their own faith. There is a reason that you believe and there is a reason, dear parent, that you want to pass along your faith to your children. While eternal security is certainly enough, I imagine that your walk with God has proved faithful and fruitful. Think of the faithfulness of God in your own life and share these stories with your children. Reflect on the result that obedience to His law has had on your life. Ponder the consequences of your own disobedience. When we remember our stumbles and trials and recount God’s provision and guidance we can assure our own children that walking obediently in faith will go well with them also.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Tell the Coming Generation (Psalm 78:1–8)</h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		incline your ears to the words of my mouth!</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	I will open my mouth in a parable;</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		I will utter dark sayings from of old,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	things that we have heard and known,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		that our fathers have told us.</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	We will not hide them from their children,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		but tell to the coming generation</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		and the wonders that he has done.</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	He established a testimony in Jacob</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		and appointed a law in Israel,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	which he commanded our fathers</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		to teach to their children,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	that the next generation might know them,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		the children yet unborn,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	and arise and tell them to their children,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	so that they should set their hope in God</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	and not forget the works of God,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		but keep his commandments;</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	and that they should not be like their fathers,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		a stubborn and rebellious generation,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>	a generation whose heart was not steadfast,</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>		whose spirit was not faithful to God.</em> </h4>

      <title>Conviction Over Compromise</title>
      <link>/home/conviction-over-compromise</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One could easily argue that without conviction there would be no reformation. Martin Luther famously said:</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason… I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Martin Luther was on the chopping block for his convictions, and he could have selfishly put them aside and lived a much more peaceful life. <strong>This is true of all reformers.</strong> Through reading God’s Word, the Holy Spirit illuminates God’s way, and therefore, man’s error. Once God’s way is known in a man’s conscience, he has two options: obey or compromise.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A foundational truth must be understood to move forward: </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Fear of God produces conviction. Fear of man produces compromise. </h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we do not have a fairly good grasp on what God actually says, we are much more prone to compromise on what we think He says. In the days of the reformers, most people knew God’s Word second hand through clergy, teachers, and tradition. This is not unlike our biblical knowledge today. Most of what we believe the Bible says comes from what we have learned from preachers, Bible study teachers, and traditions.  The real tragedy today is that this is still true even though we have more access to the Bible than ever before. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is when we study for <strong>ourselves</strong> what the Bible says that we will grow bold enough to stand on our convictions and begin reforming our own homes to be godly homes as Scripture defines. The more we study, the more we will recognize the philosophies that have become strongholds in our thinking and decision making.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ </em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">2 Corinthians 10:5</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every decision we make is based off of some philosophy or belief system that has taken root in our decision making process. As we read Scripture, we should be allowing time to consider what philosophies we believe that relate to the passage. Does our thinking fall in line with God’s Word or does our thinking conflict with His Word? Likewise, as we go through the day, we will hear various thoughts and viewpoints. Before we let those views become our views, we must weigh them against the truth of the Bible. Do we then accept the view or reject it? This is a constant process. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I believe this process is a place where we will find that maturing Christians will do quite a bit of repenting. An action is something done. We may regret an action and it is relatively easy to say that we have repented of it - we just don’t do it again. However, personal philosophies are at the root of most actions. Actions that lead to regret or require repentance often mean that we have believed something that is in conflict with God. It is here that we must recognize our tendency to adopt worldly thinking. As we begin to sift through our thoughts we will see more and more how much we have compromised on being obedient to God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Repent. Turn away from world philosophies. Do not let the world’s wisdom in your house. Make decisions for your family based on God’s wisdom and instruction. This is reformation!</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.  For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. </em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Colossians 2:8–10</h4>

      <title>What Belongs to God</title>
      <link>/home/do-not-give-to-caesar-what-belongs-to-god</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away. </em>(Matthew 22:15–22)</h4><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Give to Caesar</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through God’s design we have world systems and institutions we work within. Within those systems and institutions, we have rules. Abide by those rules, in those systems and all is well. Jesus says, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.” If Jesus wanted to merely affirm that the people should pay taxes, He could have stopped there. But He doesn’t. Jesus goes on to remind them of an infinitely bigger truth, but one we need constant reminder of. </p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Not all things belong to Caesar</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus goes on to tell them to render to God the things that are God’s. Coins are made with Caesar’s image, but we are made in God’s. We belong to God. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It would be foolishness to simply become a cog in a systemic wheel and forget that we do not <em>belong </em>to that system<em>.</em> This is especially vital when you consider the corrupt nature of world systems and institutions. We have no business identifying ourselves as a part of that corruptness. This is being <strong><em>in </em></strong>and not <strong><em>of </em></strong>the world.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Do not give to Caesar what belongs to God</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our worship belongs to God. Our love belongs to God. Our loyalty, our trust, our faithfulness, all belong to God. Our children and our families belong to God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Time and resources, both given to us by God, act as a form of currency.  </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Will our children be molded in the likeness of Caesar’s image or God’s?</h4>
</div>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Parents have handed over what belongs to God, a precious life they were given to shepherd into adulthood, to an institution based off a government model and subject to just as much worldly corruption and influence. We cannot look at where we are now and how we got here and continue to say that our children will turn out fine. Generation after generation is turning from the Lord and His ways. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When discerning where our children learn, and from whom, we must ask: Am I giving to Caesar what belongs to God?</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Faith Comes from Hearing</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The church will drift in the direction of society</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hearing the Word of God…</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think what bothers me is that I feel like we might be cultivating a heart for leadership when we should be cultivating hearts for God. How many preachers are villainized by members of their own congregation when they do uphold and teach biblical gender roles? The current social climate is very hostile to biblical womanhood, and as a result churches left and right are compromising on Scripture. If we are not confident that all of God’s Word is not only true but also beneficial we will not stand long. We will be blown in every direction by the winds of society and eventually swept away in the tides of compromise.&nbsp; Walking in faith means</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Could you imagine telling Stevie that her daughters need to sit down let the boys do it? If the thought doesn’t scare you, then you probably don’t know her. But we can never doubt the influence of the Holy Spirit. If we are speaking God’s Word, appropriately, which is to say, with the right motivation, then we should know that we might offend, but more importantly the Holy Spirit might convict. Conviction leads to obedience. Obedience leads to hindsight. Hindsight builds faith.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">the Word of God is sharper…</p>

      <title>Jealous Again</title>
      <link>/home/jealous-again</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Or: “Theology from the Bachelorette?”</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes we see the meaning of words change over time. Christmas songs offer a timely example - we giggle about “gay happy meetings” and panic at the “ox and ass” at the manger. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes the meaning of a word stays the same, but the whole concept around it changes. Something that starts as <em>unacceptable </em>is eventually embraced. The reverse is also true; we see something once <em>appropriate </em>become offensive.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I believe this is the case with the word “jealous.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we think of jealousy, we often think of controlling, abusive men that must be avoided. Just think of how this plays out on The Bachelorette - all these men want to have a “relationship” with the one girl, and if something real actually seems to be there, the man can only bite his tongue and put his emotions aside, lest he get ridiculed for not playing nice. “That one isn’t sharing!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Even worse - if he shows the slightest bit of disapproval over another man being affectionate toward the same girl that he was just also being affectionate with, flags are thrown, alarms go off, and the villain music plays. He must go. And the internet must destroy him. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now in my opinion, dating-before-marriage needs to go all together, but that’s another post - so I’m not going to get into the sheer ridiculousness of The Bachelor/ette (which at least used to be pretty entertaining - like Jane Goodall watching the gorillas - don’t judge!)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But it needs to be noted - culturally, we have absolutely demonized “jealousy.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How then can anyone in our society come to the Word of God and read of God’s jealousy without knee-jerk repulsion?</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>For you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is </em><strong><em>Jealous</em></strong><em>, is a </em><strong><em>jealous </em></strong><em>God. (</em>Exodus 34:14)</h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a </em><strong><em>jealous </em></strong><em>God. </em>(Deuteronomy 4:24)</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How can we reconcile God’s jealousy? Is God wrong to be jealous?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before we answer (although the answer is obviously “No!”), let’s also consider what Paul tells the Corinthians:</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>For I feel a </em><strong><em>divine jealousy</em></strong><em> for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. </em>(2 Corinthians 11:2)</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul also experiences jealousy, and he isn’t apologizing for it. On the contrary, he is shaming the congregation for their behavior. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It seems to be that jealousy is an emotion that we are not only allowed to have but is actually a godly virtue. God’s jealousy is an indicator that something is <em>terribly wrong</em>. Not once will we be in the right to shake our finger at God. “tsk, tsk, tsk… You better get a handle on that!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Likewise, when Paul speaks of his jealousy, it is an emotional reaction to something <em>terribly wrong</em>. The solution is not for Paul to get a grip, but for the Corinthians to get a clue. Their behavior needs to change.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we spark God’s jealousy, it is because we are giving something that belongs to Him to someone or something else. God is right to be jealous. He is the creator and sustainer of all life. He is our protector and our provider. When we look elsewhere for those things, He is right to be jealous. When we give our attention to other things, He is right to be jealous. When we worship other things, making sacrifices for them, making time for them, making plans for other things without regard to God, He is right to be jealous. And how much more do we stir His jealousy when we call ourselves His People?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The language God uses is strong - His people are whores and prostitutes (see Hosea and Ezekiel, among others). It’s strong language for a reason. It should offend us. It should trip us up. Knock us down. It is meant to get our attention and get us back on track.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Are we paying attention?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul took on the role of shepherd to many flocks. He knew that discipleship was much more than evangelism. If you were part of a congregation that Paul had influence over, he made sure he was not neglecting his responsibility of bringing you to Christian maturity.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me. </em>(Colossians 1:28-29)</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If God has given us dominion or stewardship over a people, we should absolutely be jealous when we see them straying. What God has given you, you have a right to be jealous for. Husbands <em>should </em>be jealous for their wives’ time and attention. Parents <em>should </em>be jealous for their child’s attention in training and instruction. Pastors <em>should </em>be jealous for their congregation’s ear. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul was jealous when the Corinthians were being influenced by false apostles. They were being led away from devotion to Christ. He likened them to a bride betrothed, turning to another man (2 Corinthians 11:1-4). It’s disgusting and heart-breaking, but we miss the imagery and barely recognize the fault of the Corinthians because we have villainized <strong>jealousy</strong>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sinners absolutely corrupt things: not all jealousy is divine. However, when we feel jealousy our first thought should <em>not </em>be that we need to work on ourselves, but to assess the situation. Is something amiss? Is there a responsibility that God has given me that I am neglecting? Is someone under my watch being lured away?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If we aren’t feeling jealousy at all, we might need to ask ourselves if we’ve bought into the lie that we have no claim on what God has given us! Have you desensitized yourself to the barometer of jealousy?</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>2 Corinthians 11:1–4</em></span></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me! For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough.</em></span></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

      <title>Laugh to the Glory of God</title>
      <link>/home/laugh-to-the-glory-of-god</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun. </em>(Ecclesiastes 8:15)</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our daughter’s baby book had a little place to write in something like “Our Family Story” and I remember writing, “Once upon a time Daddy made Mommy laugh. And he did it again and again and again until she married him.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And really, that pretty much sums it up. Our friendship was built on laughter, and our marriage has thrived with laughter, and laughter continues to fuel our entire family. Obviously, God is at the center of our family, but I can’t help but acknowledge the <em>gift </em>that laughter has been in our lives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I believe that’s what laughter is, a gift from God.&nbsp; But not just a gift. It’s a tool.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Laughter is a great tool for building, for mending, and for strengthening relationships. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I first came on staff at our church, we had a staff retreat. It was a time for edification and for building relationships, but I was nervous and uneasy. It was great training in a gorgeous environment, but, for me, what made it a ‘retreat’ came at those last hours of the day when we were all around the table laughing together, long after the meal was done. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the most precious times we can appreciate the gift of laughter is in the midst of our most painful times. A friend that can make us laugh in the middle of that pain offers us a temporary relief. It’s a glimpse of joy in the darkest hour, and a reminder that one day there will be no sorrow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the Psalms we see God laughing, but He is laughing at the enemies. In His laughter, He reminds us to have faith in the midst of fear.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But I believe that this joyous gift from God, this powerful tool, has become a powerful weapon – perverted and used against God’s creation.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Why are we laughing?</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider childhood. We’re all familiar with kids ridiculing and teasing someone and I think we can all sympathize with the pain of being laughed at, even if we haven’t experienced it ourselves. Some might even still carry the burden of being the instigator of that laughter.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider comedy. Not too long ago, my husband and I were watching a comedian and about halfway into the show she started making jokes about her abortion. At least half the audience was laughing with her and all I could think was, “How did we get here?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then I had a bit of an epiphany this past summer while I was chaperoning kids’ camp. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The total number of campers that week was significantly smaller than it probably should have been, and as a result of that, the already small auditorium wasn’t even half full. During the morning worship rallies they would play these videos that were supposed to be funny but I didn’t hear any of the kids laughing. What I did hear was all of the staffers sitting strategically placed throughout the groups OVERLY reacting and laughing at the videos. Whether those staffers realized it or not, they were being used as a tool to train the children to laugh at something that had no <em>truly </em>humorous quality. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sitting in that auditorium with all the fake laughs of course reminded me of TV laugh tracks. It occurred to me how manipulative they are. The laugh tracks <em>tell </em>us, and our children, how we are supposed to respond to things. So when a TV dad is a bumbling idiot, we really should be sad for that family.  But the laugh track tells us it’s hilarious indeed. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I now see how anything once viewed as clearly contrary to God’s commands can be normalized, embraced, and celebrated, <strong>even by God’s own people</strong>, through the powerful tool of laughter, and I absolutely believe that we can and should be mindful to protect this precious gift and use laughter to the glory of God.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. </em> (1 Corinthians 10:31)</h4>

      <title>Man’s Chief End</title>
      <link>/home/mans-chief-end</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our family has been using catechisms as a tool to teach foundational truths about God to our children. Now, this article is not about using catechisms, but as a side note, they are an excellent resource and seem to be coming back into popularity. Catechisms are questions and answers that help kids memorize principle concepts. <em>Memorize</em>, not necessarily <em>understand</em>; it is very good to make this distinction. It is good for children to memorize math facts before they fully understand math concepts. In this same way, children can memorize foundational truths about God and doctrine and then grow in their wisdom and understanding of them as they themselves grow in wisdom and understanding.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the first learned and most popular catechism is:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Q. What is man’s chief end?</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">A.  Man’s chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I encourage everyone to memorize this answer! It is a great answer to always have at hand or on deck. Every time we ask ourselves, “What is my purpose?” or, “Why am I doing this?” we can quickly remind ourselves, “Man’s chief end is to glorify God.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This “mantra” has proven to be very helpful in both keeping me going and in keeping me on the right track. Whenever I begin to slow down or become discouraged in the monotony of mundane things, I remind myself, “The chief end of <em>homeschooling</em> is to glorify God.” Or “The chief end of <em>cooking dinner</em> is to glorify God.” It reminds me that there is an eternal purpose in all things, and therefore, almost nothing is mundane. Even downtime can find its purpose in glorifying God. This doesn’t mean that every free minute should be used for Bible study, but that time spent recharging or reconnecting has eternal benefits and that even “stopping to smell the roses” can certainly glorify God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When it comes to <em>what</em> we do or <em>how</em> we should do it, the question of God’s glory should be our first thought. This is what helps us stay on the right track. “Does this glorify God?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This line of thinking always comes with a disclaimer. Extremes are often dangerous and it is easy to get in the ditch on either side of this road. </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><strong><em>The Ditch of Works</em></strong></span></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On one hand, don’t think that every action must be culturally seen as pious and try to stay in a constant state of perceived holiness. There are a great many Christians who struggle with pulling the biblical reins pretty tight, and adding the stipulation that they must glorify God in all they do can become a weighty burden. This is the ditch dug by works and is the same ditch that leads to legalism: the thinking that adds works to salvation. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When the burden of pious living becomes something that takes away joy, we must stop and reevaluate our perception and motives. We are created for good works and should work to please the Lord, but we should have joy and peace in that work. Remember to let your good works come from a place of love for God and not from a place of needing acceptance from Him. Acceptance came from The Cross!</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><strong><em>The Ditch of Grace</em></strong></span></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the other hand, of course, not every liberty taken is a liberty given, and the opposite ditch is the ditch dug by grace. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is important we realize what a dangerous tool grace can be in the hands of sinners. Just as godly works can be misunderstood and misused, so can godly grace. In this ditch we believe that good works are irrelevant and nearly impossible, and so we don’t even bother. In this ditch we learn that grace means we get to do whatever we want. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If we zoom out and look at both sides of the road, I think we will find that the ditch dug by grace is much larger that the ditch dug by works.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Grace goes a long way (I would argue that the depths of grace are infinite), but we should not be in the habit of seeing how much grace we can get. There is an obvious path that sinful hearts draw from Salvation by Grace straight to Acceptance of Sin. This is the path much more frequently drawn, and the reason we find Paul writing in Romans, “What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This ditch is so large, that most of the Christians in America are being raised in it. It is so large that most new churches are being planted right in the middle of it, with room to spare. Sinners love grace, and if a pastor or teacher can stay on that topic exclusively, he will do well. That is, if you’re just counting noses and nickels. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most of us are in that ditch, or will find ourselves in it several times in our lives; it’s the way our hearts lean. But just as grace can pull us out of the ditch of works, work pulls us out of the ditch of grace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Good works are a good thing. Consider again our purpose: man’s chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. And now listen to the words Jesus prayed before he was arrested. In John 17, verse 4, Jesus prays, “I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jesus glorified God by doing the work the Father gave him to do. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Likewise, we glorify God when we do the work He gives us to do. </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>God has given each of us a job to do.</em></strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is important to make distinctions in the work we do; is it the work God gave us to do or is it a task we assigned to ourselves?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I once heard an analogy made to demonstrate this point using a hired cook that was constantly cleaning, greeting, helping guests, etc. He was doing many great things, but not the job he was hired to do, and therefore, his job was not getting done. He was essentially useless despite his good works. How long can a restaurant run without a cook?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are many great things we can do, but when we pick up these jobs and neglect the jobs God gave us to do, we do not glorify God. We cannot pray to God with the acknowledgement that we have glorified Him. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When men and women get married, they have God ordained roles: husband and wife. Those are divinely appointed jobs, and should be done to the glory of God. It is not the woman’s job to be the husband; it does not glorify God for her to take up the mantle of <em>protector</em> and <em>provider</em>. It is not the man’s job to become his wife’s helpmeet; it does not bring glory to God when a husband abandons his God-given post. Men are instructed to lead their wives, to wash them in the Word, but all too often we see husbands become passive companions, at best, reluctant to ever remove a forbidden fruit from her hand. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When a person becomes a parent, God has given that person a job. God is glorified when mothers and fathers do the job appointed to them in the way prescribed to them. Parents are to raise their children in the fear and admonition of the Lord, to train their children in the way they should go, to diligently teach their children to love God and to keep his commands. This is THE job! It isn’t one for the backburner. It must not be taken lightly. The chief end of <em>parenting</em> is to glorify God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The secular world may not prioritize these roles over other jobs, but the Christian should not fall into this trap. The family is the building block of society and ground zero for discipleship. The work done in the home is the most important work done. All other jobs function to support the family. As C.S. Lewis said, <span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><strong>“The homemaker has the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose only - and that is to support the ultimate career.”</strong></span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This truth has been completely turned on its head. It seems that the idea today is that the <em>family</em> exists for the job; each member of the family is simply an individual contributor to society. Husbands and wives, fathers and mothers have abandoned their posts for far inferior positions.  We have assumed our God-given jobs were mere happenstance and perhaps inconsequential.  This is a lie running rampant and wreaking havoc in the family, the church, and the nation. God-ordained roles are not inconsequential. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Certainly, Christians should be the best employees, employers, contractors, entrepreneurs, artists, musicians, etc. All of our works should be done with honesty, integrity, and to a standard that brings glory to God. But the way we prioritize our jobs and roles must not be out of line with God. An outstanding contractor with a lonely wife and rebellious children neither glorifies God, nor enjoys Him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember the catechism and apply it wisely. Man’s chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. (Ephesians 2:10 ESV)</em></strong></h4>

      <title>More Precious than Jewels</title>
      <link>/home/more-precious-than-jewels</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ladies, know your worth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was recently reading a short story and in a particular scene, a girl of no real upbringing was dining with the queen and king. This was a newly written story, so it took on modern sentiments: the girl was irritated that she was there in the first place and eventually got up to leave without waiting for anyone to pull out her chair. The narrator was sure to tell us that she did not need anyone to do it for her. Let me stop here. Need? Why would anyone <em>need</em> someone to pull out their chair? Okay, there might be a few sincere reasonable exceptions here, but only a few. Definitely not as a general rule.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The girl’s act of defiance to etiquette did not show the character to be someone of great strength or independence, which I believe was the goal, but instead it showed her to be someone who did not know her own value. And I was sad for her.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Listen, men do not pull out women’s chairs for us because we are incapable of doing it ourselves, but to show us how valuable we are to them. Women are to be seen as a treasure - invaluable treasure! Why should someone so valuable, so irreplaceable, have to pull out her own chair? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why must she open her own door? Certainly she <em>can</em> do it herself. The act of a man opening a door for a woman makes absolutely no implication whatsoever that a woman is so weak that she can’t open a door. That is an extremely bad interpretation of the act. Instead, it demonstrates an understanding of the utilitarian role of men and the invaluably precious design of women.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Consider Proverbs 31:10.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>“An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.”</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Far more precious than jewels.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Think for a moment about what you would do if someone gave you a handful of jewels. The most likely thing would be to lock them up, to keep them safe and secure, to protect them from the elements. They would likely be in some velvet cloth in a box at the bank. Now apply that to wives: she is more precious than those jewels! So how should she be treated? Obviously we can’t take this too far; women really shouldn’t be locked up, safe and secure. But surely you can see where I am going. Women should know that they are beyond value. They should be treated as precious treasure and they should, within reason, expect to be treated as precious treasure. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course I am going to take this further, because that’s what I do!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let’s talk about career choices. Ladies, you may not <em>need</em> a man to provide for you, but you are absolutely worth being provided for!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here is a quote from C.S. Lewis:</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong><em>“The homemaker has the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose only - and that is to support the ultimate career. ”</em></strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The homemaker is the ultimate career. Cultures are formed at home, by mothers. When the mothers leave, the culture is lost. Is this not where we are? Living in a lost culture that doesn’t know right from wrong, good from evil? Has this point not been proven? It is the mother who holds the culture in her hands. The culture cannot reproduce itself coasting on the fumes of godly grandmothers and great-grandmothers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All other careers support the homemaker. The purpose of every other job is to equip the homemaker to do her job. And when her job is done well, to the glory of God, the family does well, to the glory of God. And as goes the family, so goes the nation!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hear me out on this: you cannot support the homemaker and be the homemaker too.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I wish I could convey my sentiments here properly! We must bring value back to the homemaker. We must put so much value on the role that it would be an insult to imply a girl should strive for any occupation other than homemaker. Ask a girl what she wants to be when she grows up and see how many will answer “homemaker.” Not even in most churches do girls know that “homemaker” is a career option anymore, much less the best option!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Why whatever do you mean? Obviously I pray I will one day have the ultimate career, that of homemaker.”</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ladies, we were not called to submit to the authority of some job, but to our own husbands. We do not have to yoke ourselves to some career in the name of freedom or value. That is a lie. Truly both are found in Christ and a husband under Christ’s authority will value you and give you more freedom than any job can offer. (Shoutout to my husband here!)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And speaking of husbands, sons must also be taught the value of a women. It won’t do any good at all to only teach girls their value if we fail to show our boys what treasures girls are.  Chivalry is adoration and gratitude applied. It is one thing to say a woman is a jewel, a treasure, an invaluable, irreplaceable gift from God. It is another thing to demonstrate it. Fathers must show sons by example, never failing to tell them why! </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1 Timothy 5:8 says, </p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>“But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is good to remember that this verse is talking about widows in the church, but certainly it is not only speaking of the widows. God called Christian women to the invaluable role of homemaker, and he called men to provide for and to protect that role. When we function in the roles we were designed for, we will thrive in those roles and God will get the glory.</p>

      <title>Parenting through the Old Testament</title>
      <link>/home/parenting-through-the-old-testament</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I recently read through the Old Testament for an Old Testament Survey class. As I read, I found that lessons in parenting kept standing out to me. There’s so much we can learn, not just from God’s instruction to His people but also by His example as a Father. As I read, I started to notice a pattern of how God dealt with His people as the books progress. It’s as though there is this parallel that you can draw between the age of your child and the page in the Bible. You can look at how God deals with His people in each book of the Old Testament and know a little better how to parent a child of the corresponding age.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Law (The Very Early Years)</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Genesis</strong>: Creation - You’ve created a life. You haven’t given your sweet baby any rules; you’re just spending time with them, loving them. As they get a little older, you give them boundaries, but there’s still plenty of leniency. This is also when, as a parent, you notice that things just don't go the way you hoped they would. It’s okay to be flexible in your style and try new things.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Exodus</strong>: They’re still pretty young and at this point you really don’t know who the slave is and who’s the master! Just expect lots of disobedience and utilize the time out (call it exile); it’s good for you both! This is a very good time to lay out some basic family rules. (See the 10 Commandments)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Leviticus</strong>: They’re getting old enough to have friends outside their family and they start to notice what everyone else is doing. So now you have to remind them that your family isn’t like everyone else and you find it necessary to make up crazy, gross rules that you never imagined you’d need! Your kids need to know that your standard is different from the world’s.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Numbers</strong>: You start realizing how many kids you got and how much that costs!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Deuteronomy</strong>: They are getting older, but still preschoolers and a little older. As much as they drive you crazy, spend time with your kids. It is so important to tell your kids more about God than the world tells them about anything and at this age they give you those opportunities because they are so curious. Everything is “Why?” All you have to do is be there for the questions (when they wake up, when they lie down, and as you walk through the day) and remember that every answer can get you back to God.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The History Books (The Elementary Years)</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Start teaching them some bigger life-lessons:</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Joshua</strong>: Be strong and courageous to seek and do God's will.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Judges</strong>: God uses the weak and the strong; be willing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Ruth</strong>: God generates faith in unexpected people.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1 &amp; 2 Samue</strong>l: Learn from the mistakes of others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1 &amp; 2 Kings</strong>: Even the good guys aren’t perfect.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1 &amp; 2 Chronicles</strong>: Instill in your children a love of history.</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther</strong>: They’re getting even older and your kids should have more personal responsibilities now. They play a role in the family and there’s work to be done!</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Poetry (The Teenage Years)</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Job</strong>: We really know this is for teenagers; his life was literally the worst!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Psalms</strong>: Luckily, we have the psalms for parents and teenagers alike to help us all cope during this trying time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Proverbs</strong>: They’re not out of the house yet and there are still lessons to be learned! What kind of man/woman is this child going to be? Saturate them with wisdom.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Ecclesiastes</strong>: Your soon-to-be-adult children are probably starting to look everywhere for meaning. But perspective is key. Both they and you need to remember that if they aren’t seeking God’s will, everything is in vain. Help them put God’s will above their own. Be sure not to get your own will in the way either.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Song of Solomon</strong>: Don’t stir up love until the appropriate time. Honestly, is there any reason to have a boyfriend/girlfriend before you’re old enough to marry? Encourage them to protect their heart and save all that for the right time. A much later time!</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Prophets (The Young Adults)&nbsp;</strong></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They’re about to leave the house. Things are going to get real. Consequences are real. You’re not going to be there to bail them out. Now’s the time for those last warnings and then there’s really nothing left for you to say. In a sense, you’re kind of done. It might seem like you’re in for 400 years of silence, but rest in the Lord. Jesus has it from here.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I recently read through the Old Testament for an Old Testament Survey class. As I read, I found that lessons in parenting kept standing out to me. There’s so much we can learn, not just from God’s instruction to His people but also by His example as a Father. As I read, I started to notice a pattern of how God dealt with His people as the books progress. It’s as though there is this parallel that you can draw between the age of your child and the page in the Bible. You can look at how God deals with His people in each book of the Old Testament and know a little better how to parent a child of the corresponding age.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Radical Ideas: Why We Don’t Say, “God Told Me…”</title>
      <link>/home/radical-ideas-why-we-dont-say-god-told-me</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. (Exodus 20:7)</em></span></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">I often wonder how much we pay attention to the Ten Commandments. Do Christian parents still teach them to their children? Are they memorized or even familiar in Christian homes. Is this one of those things we’re assuming our kids learn in church and so it is absent in the home? I’m sure the answers vary across families and churches, but I would like to encourage parents to go ahead and take on the task of teaching their own children the Ten Commandments!</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The first four teach us our God-given responsibilities to Him. The last six teach us our responsibilities to each other. Because the last six are about how we ourselves are to be treated, we tend to be quicker to enforce the keeping of these commandments. I want my children to honor me, I do not want to be killed, I do not want my husband to commit adultery, I do not want my stuff stolen, I don’t want people telling lies about me, and I suppose I really don’t want someone bitter because of something I have. These are actually so important to us as a society that we even have laws enforcing several. And truly, how much better would life on earth be if every pagan and Christian alike would adhere to these commandments. These are important.</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The first four, though: these commandments seemed to have fallen by the wayside. We are not very concerned with our behavior toward God. “Love your neighbor” - absolutely! But that is second to loving God! And how do we love God? Jesus tells us in John 14:15, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments.”</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">We should love God more than our neighbor! Yes, even more than our spouse and our own children. We must keep things in the right order. And I assure you, loving God more will only serve our neighbor better. They will not be abandoned.</span></p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. (1 John 5:2–3)</em></span></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So now that we’re prioritizing God, let’s look at the first four commandments and get back to my radical idea!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s absolutely worth studying and understanding all four of the first commandments and learning what proper application looks like in our time and place in history. Today, let me dive into the third one: <span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"><em>You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. (Exodus 20:7)</em></span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">My understanding of this was that we should never say “Oh my G**.” That’s a rule I grew up with and that’s the rule my kids are still under. We have even gone so far as to deem it the worst of the bad words! I tell them that we need to be more aware of how we speak of God. Even if “God” isn’t His name, we cannot speak of Him flippantly - without regard or reverence. That would be “in vain.” I also want to impress upon them the priority of God in our lives; His name in vain is the worst of the worst!</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">But that’s pretty basic and I don’t believe it fully covers the third commandment.</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Consider the statement, “God told me…” I’ve noticed more and more people saying it these days. It seems to come with some sort of holy confidence. Growing up in Southern Baptist churches, this wasn’t something I often heard, but it was becoming common in my adulthood, and I wanted in on it. There was certainly a desire to know God’s direction for my own life as a young wife and mother, and TWICE I lead a women’s group through a study called “Discerning the Voice of God.” In hindsight, I wish someone would have slapped me in the face with a Bible! It’s all there - in the Bible! There are no new revelations to be had. </span>Deuteronomy 4:2 says, “You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.” And Revelation 22:18, “I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Listen more than you pray” was what I learned from that study and, “Listen more than you pray” was what I repeated to others! Again - someone go back and slap me with a Bible, please! Instead of looking for divine answers from a voice in my head, I should have been reading God’s Word with the intention of knowing Him. The difference in my life, then versus now, reading versus “listening,” is profound. It’s the difference between confusion and confident direction. Then I “listened” but had no idea what God wanted me to do. Now I have his direction, His promises, and His purpose for me, all in black and white.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we say, “God told me…” I think what we often mean to express is the Holy Spirit’s work in our lives. He indeed is God and He indeed does teach us (John 14:26) and gives us understanding through God’s Word. But we are warned to discern the spirits and that must be done through a knowledge of God and Truth and that is through His Word.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So here’s a radical idea: Use reverence and careful consideration before you attribute something to God!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">For one, every time we say, “God told me…” we are potentially positioning God to be a liar. In fact we are then the liars. Consider all the times God has supposedly told someone they were going to do something and it didn’t happen. Did God lie?</span></p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. (Proverbs 30:5–6)</em></span></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For two, it keeps us from searching the Scriptures. Christians are not taught the sufficiency of scripture and that is a great tragedy! Instead, we are taught to close our eyes and listen, Bibles closed in our laps. If we really knew how relevant God’s Word is to every aspect of our lives, we <em>would</em> read it and be able to make informed decisions based on what God really <em>did</em> say. The Holy Spirit gives us understanding through His Word. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pray. Read your Bible. Be counseled by the Holy Spirit. And do not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.</p>

      <title>Radical Ideas: Why We Quit Sunday School</title>
      <link>/home/radical-ideas-why-we-quit-sunday-school</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. (James 3:1)</em></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was raised in church, so from probably birth through my thirties I attended Sunday School. Likewise, my children have all been raised going to Children’s Church and Sunday School classes. I think now we call them <em>Small Groups</em>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The emphasis on small groups was so strong in our old church that we even had a “Culture Statement” that “Church happens in circles, not rows.” I realized later that this statement comes from Andy Stanley’s teaching, and it really pains me how much his false teachings have infiltrated modern beliefs. Although I am sure they don’t originate from him; I think he just has a knack for tying up worldly philosophies in a neat churchy package. Of course the point here is not to start a list of false teachings in the church, but to acknowledge how tightly church culture has gripped <em>small groups</em>, and to point out that it’s perhaps time to loosen our grip.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I will concede that one can state a number of good reasons to have small groups, both for adults and for children, but those good things can’t be a barrier to assessing if it’s something that we <em>should</em> do. Let’s take on children’s small groups first.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In a traditional church environment, at least what I grew up in, children attend Sunday School classes with kids their own age, then go to church with their parents. We called that “big church.” There is also Children’s Church for some of the younger children offered during the time of the sermon. What I am seeing more and more of in both the mini-mall type churches popping up as well as the mega-church model is Sunday School for everyone up through youth happening at the same time as the actual church service. So families are at the church for about an hour: babies in nurseries, children with their group, youth with theirs, while parents attend the service. Then adult small groups are encouraged “off-campus.” Of course there are variations.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The idea is to get together with people your own age and learn in a way most beneficial for that age. There’s nothing wrong with that motivation and I am not attacking those desiring to teach young hearts about God. It’s just that sometimes we need to look at the results of our actions and determine how we should continue.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The results: We are separating generations and taking faith out of the home. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember hearing warnings about the necessity of teaching Christ at home to your children and I wasn’t sure what to do with that. Obviously we should do that. Why wouldn’t we? But the warnings were coming from the evidence that Christ was not being taught adequately at home. With the exception of church on Sundays and prayer at dinner, the typical Christian parent operates as a passive Christian model, letting the church take the active role in teaching.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I specifically remember giving the same warning to parents: “Do not rely on the church be the primary teacher of your children.” But even then I did not know the solution, because I didn’t see the root of the problem. Churches originally took on the teaching role to offer additional support to the home, but over time, that support became the singular pillar of Biblical instruction to children. If we knock that pillar down, it all crashes. Most now see children’s Sunday School as the sole mechanism for discipleship and even salvation for our children! But as a result of that…</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> 1.) Children are catered to and learn to worship in a way that pleases them. This continues as they get older and by the time they are in youth groups, they are practically attending a different church altogether. Statistically, once they go to college, they won’t come back. A Barna Group study claims that 75% of kids raised in church won’t return after high school. And my experience says that most of those that do return look for the church with the best concert experience. Doctrine be damned.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.) Children are learning from people that are not likely qualified. This is a huge theme overarching the Sunday School crisis (<strong>see James 3:1</strong>) and we will dive more into it when we cover adults. But for now, consider the fact that the biggest qualifier for a Sunday School teacher is someone that will say “Yes.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3.) Children from Sunday School grow up to be parents that don’t know any different. This was not always the way. Fathers led their families once and now we struggle to understand what that means.  The best we can do is allow the father to decide what’s for dinner and THAT’S usually a sacrifice- some submissive act to brag about in our women’s group! How often does it occur to even the most faithful church-goer to have the father of the house lead the family in Bible study and worship each night? The lack of biblical-leading fathers allows for total complacency with weak doctrine taught in churches in the first place because there is no tangible reason for more meat, for solid food, when dads are under no obligation to lead in a practical way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This last point is the most detrimental and beautiful to me. Detrimental because families relying on the church for household discipleship is a pandemic among God’s people. Perhaps a significant number of those children falling away from the faith should be attributed to a lack of family discipleship. But, acknowledging what we have forgotten is the first step to getting on the right path. Fathers that assume the role of Spiritual Leader of their family - leading them in family worship, discipling his children, washing his wife in the Word- they will demand more. They will not be complacent. They will seek out proper edification and they will pass their faith to the next generation. They will share their faith with their children and grand-children. The idea of simply singing the same songs to worship God as generations before me as well as after me is one of the most beautiful things I can imagine.</p><p class="sqsrte-small" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>A note to wives here: desire for your husband to be properly edified at church. Choosing a church based on music style or social groups should not be a top priority for your family. A family whose father is growing in knowledge in grace will produce generational fruit!</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And now for the adults. Adult small groups are garbage.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Okay, maybe that’s harsh. And certainly not all-inclusive. But hear me out. I have two points:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.) When I was growing up, I used to play this  game with my family called “Balderdash.” I hope someone reading this knows the game! It was very simple and very fun. Basically, one player read an obscure word and the other players wrote made-up definitions for that word. Then, the first player read all the definitions, including the real one and everyone voted on what they thought was the true definition. You’d get points for any guesses on your made-up definition.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s such a fun memory - it was fun to be clever and trick people into thinking your definition was legitimate. It was even more fun to just go for the laughs - not writing a definition that would get votes, but one that would make everyone laugh. I’ll always take the hit if I can make you laugh!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How is this my first point? Because adult Small Groups are almost exactly like this game! Maybe I should rephrase my initial statement: Adult small groups are Balderdash!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am a huge proponent of discussions, and I absolutely believe that iron sharpens iron, but unless your deep-diving, Bible-dissecting small group is being lead by a someone who is basically a trained pastor, called by God, your group is just playing Balderdash with the Bible. And even worse than that! We walk away giving the correct interpretation the same value as the wrong ones! As a result, we go on with life with this idea that the very interpretation of God’s Word is up for grabs, choosing how obedience to simple commandments work best for our lives, our families, our time. Under this model, we undervalue the authority of Scripture ad the role of pastors. This leads me to the second point.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.) What in the world are we paying our pastor for? The role of pastor has completely shifted away from a shepherd called by God to lead His flock, to something more like a CEO that went to seminary. As a matter of fact, the role of pastor is so undervalued that we believe that anyone with a desire to learn must be called by God (often against the man’s will) and anyone with a desire to preach is called by God (according to the man’s own will). The man we want to pay to lead the church is the one who will grow the numbers. On Sunday mornings we listen to sermons designed to appease the masses and then we’re told that if we want to go deeper we should join a small group, where we circle back to discussions with unqualified leaders with no authority.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This model is a disaster. We require nothing from the pulpit but TED Talks and laughs. We have forgotten that it is God who calls, not man, and that the position is a high calling, not to be taken lightly. Losing the standard for the role of Pastor will continue to have calamitous effects on the body of Christ.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. (Ephesians 4:11–14)</em></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So here’s a radical idea! Instead of everyone going their own way every Sunday morning, stay together! Learn together! Find a pastor that will teach all of God’s Word accurately and then bring what you learn into your home -  teaching your own children all week long. Rinse and Repeat :)</p>

  <blockquote><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A dead thing can go with the stream, but only a living thing can go against it.</p><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> - G. K. Chesterton</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am not a huge fan of cleaning house, but I do enjoy a clean house and I do want to provide a clean house for my family. There are some people that love to clean and so they have no dilemma here. There are others that despise cleaning and have determined that the cost of cleaning far outweighs the benefit of a clean home. For me, a clean house is worth the work, but I am not excited about it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One thing I find truly irritating is the need to clean what hasn’t been used. Surfaces get dusty. Corners get grimy. Water corrodes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Things left unchecked get nasty. This is lame, but it’s the fallen world we live in.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I suppose that the hard truth we all have to face is that when we let ourselves go unchecked, we too get nasty! </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There’s no question here. We cannot go about life like it’s a lazy river and expect to have any real growth, neither natural (maturity) nor super-natural (spiritual maturity). The flow of the river is always down. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Swimming upstream is work. Cleaning is work.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul tells us to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12). </p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Considering modern American history, the divide-and-conquer attack on the family is at an all time high. And there is a reason for it. The family is the God-ordained building block of society. </p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><strong><em>“As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live.”</em></strong></span></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is spiritual warfare if it is not a battle over the truth? The question is always </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">…Please feel free to reflect on all those things and even more, but I am going to hone in on  another one: our children. This is where my heart really responds to this passage: <strong>our children belong to God</strong>, but more and more we are giving them to Caesar.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I feel very convicted over the fact that parents are accountable for the training and instruction of their children. The Bible seems to be so clear on that, I’m actually surprised it’s a controversial statement. (See Deuteronomy, Proverbs, Ephesians, etc.) If our children belong to God, then we are stewards of their care, given instructions by God on how to instruct them. Instead of taking this task seriously, we assume this training happens has a by-product of merely living and we send them on their way - into the hands of Caesar as early as we can. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now I am not making a case for keeping children exclusively at home; outside help is often not just necessary but beneficial. But parents must consider the cost when they start outsourcing their job to others. This child isn’t really just yours to do with what you like. This child belongs to God and was given to you for a time, for a reason. When I think of the things I have taught my children, I am, well, filled! It’s not just reading and math; it’s manners and character and how much God loves them and why we love God. It’s when we lie down and get up and when we walk through the day. Everything becomes an opportunity to disciple them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And here’s the thing about teaching: you learn! Again, I don’t just mean reading and math (although I can’t deny I haven’t learned anything new there). I’ve also learned better manners and my character has improved. I’ve learned so much more about God’s love for me and my love for God grows every day. There’s nothing quite like trying to teach and model love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control to the very people you are with ALL. DAY.  LONG. There’s no hiding your shortcomings. If children have one purpose, it is to systematically test and prove their parents’ weaknesses. This is sanctification!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our families belong to God…. So here are our children - made in the image of God, given to us for us to mold in the image of Christ, given to us as, hands-down, God’s <em>best </em>method to mold us into Christ’s image, but we say, “I’d rather they look more like Caesar.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have clearly been deceived and it breaks my heart. I mourn for <strong>thousands </strong>of hours mothers are missing with their children. The lessons never taught. The wisdom never gained. I don’t know that we’ll ever really be able to calculate the full cost of  separating mothers and children all day. We haven’t even touched on what they are learning. Not just from teachers, but from every person they are around. What they learn is no longer in you’re control, but you are still accountable to God for it.</p>

      <title>The Art of Wifery</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Proverbs 31:10</h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>An excellent wife who can find?</em></h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em> She is far more precious than jewels.</em></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t think I have met anyone lately who prefers to be called <em>Mrs</em>. Of course, a quick stroll through Hobby Lobby will prove though that there must be a moment in many girls’ lives when “Mr. and Mrs.” paraphernalia becomes a desired décor theme. However, I imagine that the desire to purchase or display the “Mrs.” title quickly wanes with the coming of the next season’s trend. I do not think I have heard a married woman who was called “Miss” request that she be called “Mrs.” since I was in the second grade. I remember that rebuke well because it was quite unexpected. It wasn’t a suggestion; it was a correction. She was married and that wasn’t just a small detail, it was her identity. </p><p class="sqsrte-small" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I need to interject a quick thought here - It is taking me a long time to find words for this post because saying things about a woman's identity being wrapped up in her marital status has become offensive. Dare I even say that a woman <em>belong </em>to a man? But here lies the reason for this post. Read on and let me make my case. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We need to start in Genesis!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him. So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. </em>Genesis 2:18–22</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Esther: she never overstepped. She was able to save the Jews from Haman not by telling her husband what to do but by being a treasure to him and respectfully asking. Compare to Jezebel!</p>

      <title>The Family Reformed: Basics</title>
      <link>/home/the-family-reformed-basics</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>What do you mean “Reformed”?</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Think of Christianity as a cast-iron skillet. It's pretty solid, nearly unbreakable, and lasts a life-time. More than that, actually! It passes down through generations. I still cook with my grandfather’s cast-iron skillet.  But how many of us have gotten out that skillet to find that we had put it away without drying it fully? Take that heavy, indestructible, far superior skillet and add something that seems as pure and harmless as water to it and it really won’t take long to find it’s starting to rust.  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our Christian churches and Christian families are built on beliefs that are solid, but we are not impervious to faulty thinking. We are not incorruptible. Seemingly harmless world-views and philosophies get in and quickly start to corrupt our Christian beliefs and practice. Like rust on an iron skillet. Sometimes this can go on until what was once worthy of passing on to children and grand-children now looks like garbage and they want nothing to do with it.  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So the best thing about cast iron? You can clean it up! Even the rustiest skillets can be restored and made to look like new! “Reforming”  is like restoring. It’s like getting a metal scrub pad and cleaning off the rust. I love how indestructible cast iron is, and Christianity is even more than that. But our churches and our families often require de-rusting and re-seasoning.&nbsp;Let’s get scrubbing!</p><h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;<strong>Reformed Family Basics</strong></h3><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Read to know God.</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The first thing you want to do is read your Bible. But don’t just read to check that box. And, at least for now, don’t read to find personal application in every verse. Don’t read it as a meaningless history book. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Man's chief end, our purpose, is to glorify God. So start by reading your Bible to know God. Learn who He is from His own Word. Knowing who God is allows us to rightly practice our belief in Him. This brings Him glory and honor and praise. Sloppy, lazy, anything-goes Christianity only works to diminish God’s reputation. We become something more like a barrier to His glory rather than a demonstration of it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Start in Genesis. What’s the first thing you learn about God? Straight up – God is Creator.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Now keep reading with that perspective: God is Creator. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Who are you, o man? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To fear the Lord is to place Him properly and place ourselves accordingly. Don't read God’s Word through the lens of what you already know or how you feel. Let what you read become the lens through which everything else is understood. Keep reading, always asking&nbsp;God to give you a correct picture of Himself, destroying any false images we have made.</p></li><li><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Submit to the authority of God's Word</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As you continue to read God’s Word, submit yourself, your marriage, and your parenting to the instruction of the Lord – clearly given to us in Scripture. Know your role. Let Scripture define your responsibilities and boundaries, and prayerfully submit to them. Know that God gave us instruction for our good. The Creator of heaven and earth, church and family, knows the design and gave us the manual. Follow it! </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a quote I love from a character in a C.S. Lewis book – “There are a dozen views about everything until you know the answer. Then there's never more than one.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> There’s only one true interpretation of Scripture, and yes – we are fallen, so we certainly are capable of misinterpreting. I don't think that should allow us to make excuses. God’s Word was not written exclusively to theologians to decipher and decode for the layman. It's pretty straightforward for the most part. The Holy Spirit enables us to understand, illumines various texts at various times, and equips us to live obedient to the Word. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am skeptical of people that make excuses for differing interpretations. Especially when it allows for a wide open, to-each-their-own mentality. It's like saying <em>any combination of numbers will work to open a combination lock, as long as you turn right, turn left one full rotation, turn right.</em> The motion might be correct, but nothing clicked in place. But the reality is, once the truth clicks in place, it's silly to give it the same weight as any other viewpoint. The right interpretation is in fact the right interpretation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you know the truth, submit to it. Don’t make excuses, but ask for God’s strength and guidance. Living biblically is absolutely going against the current. You will feel resistance. But God’s grace is sufficient to keep us going, and even flourish in obedience.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p></li><li><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Family Worship&nbsp;</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is the Great Commission? To make disciples - teaching  them to obey Jesus’ commands. Funny how this seems to be the greatest motivator for mass evangelism while true discipleship has been forgotten. There is a push in the church to get parents to serve everywhere but in their own home and everyone but their own family. At the surface, this push to serve not only seems harmless, but noble and right. We should serve, right? And my goodness, we need volunteers, don’t we!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have countless programs and activities in place to offer some resemblance of discipleship to our children. These children’s programs have been elevated to the status of necessary for true discipleship. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I believe, though, that what many are failing to see is that these programs remove children from proper discipleship and instead offer a watered-down, chaotic, hour-long substitution. We’ve become satisfied, nay, we praise this sort of “discipleship” and have forsaken intentional, daily teaching in our homes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And what has been the result? The need for more programs, of course! Because each generation of undiscipled children is actually growing - the reverse of what should be happening. We must return to family worship!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What does that look like? It’s a simple as fathers reading and discussing God’s Word with their families. It’s praying and singing together. Put the burden of Sunday School back on the father’s shoulder. Church should be supplemental, not primary. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian parents have forgotten that their most important job on this earth, for this time, is to disciple their children. Don’t just get your children to accept Christ, teach them to follow Him! Teach them all he has commanded us. This is THE job. It isn’t something that should be diminished and outsourced.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Join a Bible Believing / Bible Preaching Church&nbsp;</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Church cannot and should not replace Family Worship. But neither can Family Worship replace Church! Belonging to a church is necessary for all believers. It is necessary for strengthening individuals, families, communities, and the world! We must join with the body of believers to worship God and build each other up.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The current trend in churches is to be a church for the lost. If you’re not lost, don’t go to that church! It’s not for you! Go to a church that elevates God above man - <em>even lost man</em>. Go to a church that has a stated <em>and practiced</em> commitment to worshipping God. This does not mean that the lost will fall by the wayside - God knows how to find the lost. The lost don’t know how to find themselves. How can we let what appeals to the lost determine our liturgy? Instead, the church should strengthen and equip believers for evangelism in their daily lives and discipleship in their homes.  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Join a church that recognizes the authority of Scripture. In the same way that parents should submit to the authority of Scripture in their lives, so should church leaders submit to that same authority. What good is a church or church leader that will compromise on Scripture? Suddenly there is no authority, no standard, no playbook. Eventually every command will be gray and obeyed at the discretion of individual feelings.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If your pastor is preaching from what seems like an abridged version of the Bible, you'll end up carrying the load God ordained pastors to carry. Fathers will struggle to find the time to both provide for their family and  study God’s Word with the zeal and depth that God called pastors to do. Mothers will feel lost and unsupported in raising children in a biblical, counter-cultural way. A good church equips believers with sound doctrine which is useful for healthy marriages, for raising fruitful children, and for proper evangelism in the believers’ daily walk. </p></li><li><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Persevere&nbsp;</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is a life-long endeavor and it is absolutely worth the effort. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our natural tendency is to fill our time with the wrong things. Are the demands of life worth forsaking the spiritual health of our family? Every day is a new day with new mercies, a new opportunity to read the Bible with your spouse and with your children. It’s never too late to begin. Or begin again. Again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stay in the Word and in prayer and in church and keep running the race. Fight the good fight and keep the rust off the skillet.</p></li></ol>

      <title>Truth and Love</title>
      <link>/home/truth-and-love</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have a tendency in modern Christian culture to put <em>truth </em>and <em>love </em>on opposite sides of a pendulum. If we swing over to the truth side, then we tend to feel we are somehow being unloving. If we go over to the love side, then we feel we aren’t able to tell people the truth. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The truth can often seem to be offensive, and <em>offensive </em>typically means <em>unloving</em>, right? So the thinking here is that if we are to tell someone the truth, we must limit it in a way as to not offend them. In this way, <em>love </em>actually functions as a muzzle to <em>truth</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is this right? Play this out in your head for a minute: you don’t want someone to get upset so you don’t say anything that upsets them. How far does that get you with your children? It certainly shouldn’t be your aim to upset your children, but any parent knows that trying to raise a child without ever upsetting them absolutely <em>spoils</em> their character. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now apply this same logic with believers, whether children growing in faithful homes or adult believers growing in Christ. If we hold back the truth because we fear hurt feelings, then we will stunt their spiritual growth and inevitably <em>spoil</em> their Christian character. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I wish I could hand you a glass of spoiled milk right now. Imagine taking a huge gulp of spoiled milk. I feel like it’s worth the mental picture because the physical response we have over drinking spoiled milk should pale in comparison to our own distaste of spoiled believers. The standard in discipleship should be much higher. We should desire the truth, even when the truth makes us uncomfortable. We are most loved by those who will tell us the truth.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""> <span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. (</em>Ephesians 4:11–16)</span></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Paul says to speak truth <em>in </em>love. Truth and love should never fall opposite of each other. If they did, that would put <em>love </em>on the same side of the pendulum as <em>lies</em>,<em> </em>and <em>truth </em>over there with <em>hate</em>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If we are holding back on the truth of God’s Word, we <strong>cannot </strong>say that it is because of love. It isn’t <em>love </em>to want someone’s spiritual growth stunted. It shows neither love for God nor love for the person. Preachers must preach God’s Word, parents must teach it, and friends must share it. We must not think that pointing out wrong beliefs or false teachers is unloving. Surely we should desire the truth for ourselves and for others - for the spiritual growth of the whole church and the benefit of generations to come. We will indeed stunt our growth if we forsake a truth hard to hear for comfort.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Love should not be the inhibitor of truth, but the motivation for telling the truth.</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Think of truth as a ship, taking you closer and closer to God. Love, then, is the fuel that makes the vessel go. Love is fuel - not brakes - there are no brakes on a boat! Without the motivation of love, you speak less truth. You won’t go very far and, as Paul says, we become tossed to and fro by false doctrines, human cunning, and deceitful schemes. If a preacher in a church is holding back on the Word of God, he should expect his congregation to follow any charismatic leader or new philosophy and they’ll never know the difference. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Likewise, parents must teach their children all of God’s Word. Discuss it, apply it, and correct them as they grow. They are on this vessel with you for now, but it is your goal to get them to steer their own vessel. No loving parent wants a shipwrecked child. In love, teach them the truth. Teach them how to love their own children by speaking truth, never separating <em>truth </em>and <em>love</em>.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. </em>Ephesians 4:25</h4><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

      <title>Watch Out!</title>
      <link>/home/watch-out</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to learn from my mistakes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to learn from others’ mistakes. I want to help my children learn from the world around them so that they can live with minimal regret. I often find myself asking <em>why</em>. Why did this happen? I want to single out that one primary cause that led to some calamitous effect. That unseen thing that gave birth to the seen. If I’m following someone on a rocky path, I want to avoid the specific stone that made that person stumble. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pointing out stumbling blocks, so to speak, is what burdens my heart; I am grieved to see others lose their footing. I am beyond grateful to those who have guided me away from cliffs and out of danger. And I cannot, in any good conscience, turn a blind eye to others struggling. This is the primary motivation for this whole blog!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ezekiel 33:6 says, <span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">“But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.”</span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Although I am clearly not Israel’s watchman, I have never been able to ignore the implications of this verse. How can I see danger coming and not warn, especially those I love?</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul. (Ezekiel 33:7–9)</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have we been given a word from the mouth of God? Absolutely!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There must be a foundational, absolute, truth that is used to show the way. God’s Word. It isn’t the watcher’s guess or opinion given as a warning to the people; it is from the Lord, absolutely omniscient and absolutely good.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Consider what an amazing time it is to live right now with the complete Word of God always at our finger tips. We are not Israel relying on the prophets. We have been given more. We are not 1st Century Christians with limited access to the Scriptures and teachings of the apostles. We have been given more. We are not Christians in the Middle Ages without translations in our own language. We have been given more! And yet so many Christians continue to walk such rocky, dangerous paths without any real regard for the Word of God.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Again, here I go…. What is the cause for shallow, clumsy Christian lives in such a rich time of resources? We not only have the <em>very</em> sufficient Scriptures, we have the experiences and teachings of those who have faithfully lived and studied and preached the Word of God. What is our excuse? Why do we turn a blind eye to the innumerable warnings along the path? Why do so many Christians seem to be so complacent?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why sin, of course! More specifically, though, I think that it is the modern church’s <em>perspective</em> of sin that is causing calamity in the lives of believers. We seem to be mostly okay with it. Mostly okay with Sin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sadly, I have heard many friends and even family members make comments regarding sin like, “You can’t escape it, so why try,” or “God doesn’t care about the little things.” This attitude regarding sin and God is simply not biblical and is truly detrimental.  <em>(Even the hairs on your head are numbered, Luke 12:7. Because you are lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth, Revelation 3:16. The complacency of fools destroys them, Proverbs 1:32. Put to death therefore what is earthly in you, Colossians 3:17.)</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Surely our whole lives are the sum of “little things.” When we ignore God in the little things, we ignore God in most of our life. Likewise, when we consider God in the little things, we consider God in most of our lives. And if we ignore the sin in the little things of life, we ignore most of the sin in our lives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let’s correct our view of sin. It is first and foremost right and good to know that the punishment of sin is death and to know that Christ has redeemed His people - He has paid the debt for believers’ sin and through Him we can live eternally. Let us praise God and truly have peace with this knowledge. But let our understanding of sin not die at the cross also. The effects of sin are still felt on this side of death. Sin brings destruction in our lives. It destroys our relationships with our families, our friends, our church and strains our relationship with God. The very nature of sin is against God and therefore every act of sin is against God’s perfect design for life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The modern American church has a very weak view of sin. Most preachers do not properly warn believers of the harm sin produces in a Christian’s life. And once again, I am asking, “Why?” Why aren’t we warned? Why are we no longer exhorted to put to death the sin in our lives in a way that compels us to act? And again the answer must be sin. We like it. It’s comfortable. People who tell us not to sin make us uncomfortable. Sermons that call us to a life of repentance are unpopular.  And even when we hear the truth, sin itself blinds us to the warnings! Sin deceives - even believers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sin’s deception is the reason we must take an active role in the mortification of our sin. Passively, we will be complacent. We will get cozy and comfortable with the sin in our lives and not realize the danger coming. We will set our children up for pain and destruction in their lives as we raise them. We will be ineffective in discipling one another, failing to guide others along the right path and keep them from stumbling. From falling. From strife. From divorce. From drunkenness. From disobedience. From destruction. From sin.</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>The Call of Wisdom</em></span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice; at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: “How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you. Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded, because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof, I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you, when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me. Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD, would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof, therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices. For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them; but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.” (Proverbs 1:20–33)</em></span></p></blockquote>

I want to help my children learn from the world around them so that they can live with minimal regret. I often find myself asking Why. Why did this happen? I want to single out that one primary cause that led to some calamitous effect. That unseen thing that gave birth to the seen. If I’m following someone on a rocky path, I want to avoid the specific stone that made that person stumble.  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pointing out stumbling blocks, so to speak, is what burdens my heart; I am grieved to see others lose their footing. I am beyond grateful to those who have guided me away from cliffs and out of danger. And I cannot, in any good conscience, turn a blind eye to others struggling. This is the primary motivation for this whole blog!</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>When a Fish is a Fish</title>
      <link>/home/when-a-fish-is-a-fish</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A mentor of mine would often ask, “How does a goldfish glorify God?”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">By simply being a goldfish.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God created us with design and purpose and the two work together. In biology, if I recall correctly, it’s stated that “form equals function.” What we know at the most microscopic levels is that it is the form of a molecular structure that determines it’s function. It does not do any good for mitochondria to function as anything other than mitochondria. As a matter of fact, if said mitochondria were to quit performing it’s designed function and attempt to do another job, it would cause problems. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">See how molecular science glorifies God! We get to see glimpses of our infinitely intelligent creator when we observe His creation functioning as it was designed. (At best we can merely observe such intelligence, and then we pat ourselves on the back with such pride just for noticing. But let’s save that for another day!)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The goldfish glorifies God by being a goldfish. God created a goldfish to be a goldfish and we can observe the beauty and wonder of that cute little thing swimming contentedly in it’s bowl, back and forth. If the fish for one moment decided it wanted to be a dog, it might jump out of the water but would struggle for breath and never get even the slightest “bark” in.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A fish that tries to be a dog does not glorify God. It defies God. And it dies. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And then there are some that might even have the audacity to ask, “How could God let such a thing happen?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We live and breathe thanks to God’s design, but we were created for more than life in the sense that a goldfish has life. We were uniquely made in God’s image and with a purpose.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”</em></span></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	So God created man in his own image,</em></span></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	in the image of God he created him;</em></span></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	male and female he created them.</em></span></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” (Genesis 1:26–28)</em></span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All things are made for God’s own glory. But in our rebellion, we seek our own glory and buck against God’s design; we think we know better than God. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~A fish that begs to be a dog does not have God’s own glory in mind.~ </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have to acknowledge our tendency to go against God, because when we ignore it, we convince ourselves that God wants us to be something that we were never designed to be. It is something we must guard our hearts against, but for many generations we have not.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The unguarded passivity of most American Christians through the last few generations has passed on a legacy of great confusion. God’s design for male and female has been covered over and buried deep in mantras of: “You can be whatever you want to be,” “Whatever makes you happy,” and the like. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Aren’t these really the same messages we want to hear from God? And so rather than consider if our fallen nature has altered our perspective of what is in fact <em>good</em>, we instead become the <em>better </em>parent by insisting our children decide what is best for themselves. We then throw whatever resources we have at the dream and call it sacrificial parenting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fallen man loves himself the most and “self-love” becomes justified when we transpose it onto our children. It is a noble thing to work more to have a nicer house… for your kids.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So Christian parents with unguarded hearts have stolen the truth of God’s design and exchanged it for the lie that in fact, your heart is <em>not </em>deceitful and should actually be followed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The result is that now most churches are filled with confused congregations looking for ways to feel better about themselves. They are Christian fish, trying to be dogs, gasping for air, and praying the remedy makes them better dogs. Their life is faithless. <a href="https://femina.libsyn.com">Nancy Wilson</a> once said something like, “Faith agrees with God.” Let that sink in. </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Faith agrees with God.</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A faithful congregation comes to the Word of God with open ears and open hearts, itching to learn how their creator says to live, wanting to identify every lie they believed that led them down a path away from God. A faithful people agrees with the Psalmist:</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	Through your precepts I get understanding;</em></span></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	therefore I hate every false way. (Psalm 119:104)</em></span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we align our hearts with God, we desire His glory, not ours. We then must ask, what can I do to glorify God? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Are you a wife? Are you a mother? Are you a goldfish?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A woman that glorifies God is one that seeks to know God’s design for a woman and faithfully walks in agreement with God, not mankind. A man glorifies God by being a biblical man, looking only to God, His Word and godly counsel to define that role. Part of biblical womanhood and manhood involves passing on these truths to the next generation. Passivity is not an option. Be diligent - diligent in learning, in doing and in teaching.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">…Always Reforming</h1><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>domus reformatus, semper reformandus secundum verbum Dei</em></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many familiar with the Protestant Reformation are also familiar with the phrase <em>ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda</em>&nbsp;which means “the church reformed, always reforming.” In the 1900s Karl Barth added “secundum verbum Dei” :  <em>ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda secundum verbum Dei</em>&nbsp;: the church reformed, always reforming according to the Word of God</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The American Church is in dire need of reformation. We have forgotten the “always reforming according to the Word of God” part! We have let the American culture creep into the walls of our sanctuaries and Sunday School classrooms like termites unnoticed for generations. It’s a huge problem and it’s just a bit overwhelming for any one individual to try to fix. So what can one do? </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">It starts at home!</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reform from the ground up. The family itself, likewise, is in dire need of reformation. The family is the first congregation God has called you to and it is the most obvious sphere of influence you have. This is hands down the most worthy, and often times most neglected, calling from God. So we have a new motto now : <strong>The household reformed, always reforming according to the Word of God.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>The Authority of Scripture</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Without a doubt, the backbone of reformation is the authority of Scripture. This is true of church and household. It is necessary to always be reforming, always according to the Word of God. It is far too easy for sin-corrupted philosophies and traditions to influence our common practices. There has to be a foundational belief in the authority of Scripture in order to reject those customs with any real boldness.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>The Sufficiency of Scripture</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> A great deal of discernment is also required to reform a family. What stays? What goes? The Bible is often overlooked as a means for tackling modern-day problems and so we often look for answers elsewhere. (I mean, really, we’ll look anywhere except the Bible!) If we believe there is nothing new under the sun, then there is nothing new under the sun. Therefore, there must be no such thing as uncharted territory; everything that seems new is only a matter of identification and categorization. The answers are there - in God’s holy Word; we just need to correctly identify the problem.</p>

          <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Glad you asked!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” </em>Matthew 28:18–20</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The American culture has been heavily shaped by Christianity. This is good! Praise God for that! Of course, sinful people always find a way to corrupt even the best of institutions. The Family Reformed recognizes the need to always be “weeding the garden.” Ideals of the world creep into the nation, then regions, then communities, then churches and finally, Christian families.  The idea behind The Family Reformed is to equip, strengthen, and embolden families to push back. Christian families have to start scrutinizing every belief that affects their decision making. Is it truly a biblical belief? Is this in step with God or man?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reform the families; don’t settle for anything less than Biblical reformation in the churches; influence the communities significantly more than they influence you. This is how we see discipleship! Start where you are, but expect the fruits of your labor to reach beyond your own reach in both proximity and time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”  </em>Acts 1:8</p>

      <title>A Crown Full of It</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/a-crown-full</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many Christians have read in the Bible about the different crowns believers receive in heaven. 2 Timothy 4:8 speaks of a crown of righteousness. James 1:12, the crown of life, also in Revelation 2:10. 1 Peter 5:4 tells us of the crown of glory. But what most people don’t realize is that there is another crown not mentioned; it is the Loophole Crown.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Loophole Crown is given when believers find loopholes in the Law. It is through these loopholes that Christians, although appearing to be disobedient to Christ, actually stay within the Law because of some clever technicality.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Obviously, this is a special crown for only the most cunning of Christians, but if you have an especially crafty Christian guide, he could help you find and follow the loopholes to ensure your very own crown.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This technique requires the Christian to pay very close attention to the Law. Every jot and tittle. I know what you’re thinking: isn’t that Legalism?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Well, it’s only Legalism when your focus is on the Letter of the Law with the intention of being too strict. Focusing on the Letter of the Law to find ways out of the Law, with total disregard for the spirit of the Law, is not only well within our Christian rights, it’s rewarded.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everyone knows their favorite child is the one that pushes the boundaries and squirms out of responsibility. The favorite employee is always the slimiest one - finding all the ways to do anything but what they were hired to do. This is surely how God feels about the Loophole Believer! He’s likely super impressed with all the work they don’t do, with all the guidelines they don’t follow, with all the examples they don’t set. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So while other believers may hear, “Well done, my good and faithful servant” these Loophole Believers will get the very coveted <em>High-Five </em>and be called “Bruh” when given their crown. Not to mention, this crown is one you get to keep while everyone else is casting their crowns before the throne.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. </em><strong><em>Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven</em></strong><em>, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. </em>(Matthew 5:17–19)</h4>

      <title>Grace Abounds</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/grace-abounds</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? </em>(Romans 6:1)</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ancient legend tells of preachers of yore that were so hard on their congregations that everyone… well actually, I don’t know what happened to them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fire and Brimstone is what they preached. Nothing ever came from the pulpits other than frightful warnings of hell and sin and eternal damnation. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Church discipline, they say, actually happened. When members of the congregation claimed Christianity but lived contrary to it, the preacher, it is rumored, called that person out on his behavior.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now I have never in my life met such a preacher. But everyone knows of them. They were so bad that the stench of their intolerance still lingers in most churches today. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christians don’t need Hell and Brimfire preaching, do we? All that does is turn people away from Christ, right? After all, we are saved by grace. There is no condemnation for Christians. Right? So if there is no condemnation, then surely there is no longer sin. And if there is no longer sin, then we need to only hear of God’s grace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Grace. That’s what we want. Give us grace. We don’t need to hear about anything we might be doing wrong. We want grace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We want grace like the Israelites in the wilderness wanted meat, and I’m afraid that’s what we’re getting. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>And say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat. You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’</em> (Numbers 11:18–20)</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">………………………………………….</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Then a wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground. And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague. Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving. </em>(Numbers 11:31–34)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Surely we’re making ourselves sick. We live lives so full of undisciplined abounding grace, that there isn't a trace of holy sanctification left among us. There is more Fruit of the Spirit found in your disciplined Buddhist neighbor than there is in a whole congregation sometimes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And would we have it any other way? I suppose we are no different from the Israelites. I truly think we would rather  suffer the wrath of God with bellies full of grace than to be told how to improve upon our sinful condition each week.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And I suppose the Romans were no different from us. It seems Paul knew that they would try to justify their own continuing sin: so that grace may abound.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? </em>(Romans 6:1–2)</h4>

      <title>HELLO. My name is “Christian”</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/hello</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hello. My name is Christian. I am not really sure what that means, but I was given this name tag at the door. I keep trying to get an answer, but no one can tell me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I guess we’re supposed to listen to the guy on stage, but I don’t think he knows either. Maybe I missed it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It looks like everyone has the same badge, so really I don’t see any reason to wear it. Except that I heard someone say that it’s the only way into heaven.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think it’s supposed to make us different somehow. But I guess that doesn’t happen until we die. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have lots of name badges just like mine to give away to other people, too. I think there is a reward system based on how many people you can get to wear the  “Christian” badge. I still haven’t found where to redeem my rewards yet. Just add that to the list of unknowns. I feel like such a newb, but I’ve been here all my life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Each week we get together for music and coffee and we talk about how hard life is. Then we hear an uplifting “message” from the man on stage and that seems to get us through the week. But the fuel doesn’t last long, because everyone is back with more complaints the next week. I guess the plan is to keep getting together each week to share our struggles until we finally die and then everything is fine because we’ll be in heaven. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Heaven is supposed to be pretty great. There’s this guy there named “God.” Well, I think he’s there. I guess it’s like his house. I mean, it makes no difference to me who he is. I guess it’s better than the other place.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think he’s supposed to be a father figure or something. (A bit of an absent dad if you ask me.) I’m supposed to tell people about him. Oh, and his son. But no one is really telling me anything about the guy, so I’m pretty clueless about what to say. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most of the songs we sing are about him, but I haven’t learned much there either. He loves me. He loves me. Oh, he loves me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I guess that’s all we need to say about the man, right? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every once in a while I feel like I want to know more about God, but whenever I try to start a conversation about him everyone acts like I’m their 10th grade teacher showing up to a party with a pop quiz. I think the trick is to stop asking questions and just sing.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Pray then like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.</em> (Matthew 6:9)</h4>

      <title>It’s Spa Day!</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/its-spa-day</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's Spa Day! Sundays are usually spa days. The work week is so full of worries and troubles and people making you feel like you can't do anything right.  But Spadays - I mean Sundays - are the days I get fed. And because it's God's house, I even get “holy daycare.” There are so many people that just love taking care of me and my kids. That's not really my thing. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I need my church to be a place where I can come and not worry about my kids or have any responsibilities. I just need to be poured into. I just need assurance that I'm loved just the way I am. I just need fellowship with other women. I need a place to vent about my husband. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Since my husband doesn't come with us anyway, I'm actually thinking about going to the divorced women’s fellowship group that's starting next month. It’s called “Un-Tied” and their theme verse is Galatians 5:1. Most of my friends will be in there. They are really a great source of comfort to me. They know of all sorts of resources on living your best life. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes I wish my church offered more for me, but I'm always a little disappointed when they make announcements because it seems like they're always just requests for volunteers. But that's definitely my only complaint. I keep dropping hints that we need more fun stuff, so I'm still hopeful. Not just for me, I'm not being selfish! It would be great if the kids had more things too. And what parent wouldn't want more “holy daycare”? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I'm always thinking of great ideas like that. I sort of have a knack for knowing what people want. And I know that this church needs - I've been coming here all my life!</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. </em>(Mark 10:45)</h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him. </em>(Malachi 3:18)</h4><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

The work week is so full of worries and troubles and people making you feel like you can't do anything right.  But Spadays - I mean Sundays - are the days I get fed. And because it's God's house, I even get “holy daycare.” There are so many people that just love taking care of me and my kids. That's not really my thing. </p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Preacher or Peloton Instructor</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/my-preacher-the-peloton-instructor</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m so blessed to have a preacher that is almost a bona fide Peloton instructor. I think he has a few more life-coach type classes, but I am confident he will be certified in no time. He’s a natural encourager and coach and you really feel that in his sermons. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From him I have learned that these are times for loving my neighbors. I am naturally so in-tune with what might be offensive that it is practically my super-power, so I’ve got loving my neighbors covered. That’s great because that’s like God’s only rule. Since I can follow that rule without even trying I can focus entirely on myself. Having time to focus on me is absolutely necessary because I’m kind of a hot mess. I often feel like I am alone and facing constant struggles and I'm tempted to blame myself and look for things I need to change, but my preacher helps me see that I’m actually doing everything right. I was perfectly made. It’s just that I live in a fallen world and Satan is constantly in my ear telling me I shouldn’t do this or that. Not only that, but sometimes God <strong>needs </strong>me to fight Goliath. So life is hard. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every week I feel completely beat up and unloved by the same world that I am so good at loving. All of my relationships have been struggles and none have lasted. Why is everyone so selfish? Even though I make sure to tell him what my love language is, I have yet to meet a man that will love me enough to<em> love me</em> the way I want to be loved. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sunday mornings are when I get my love tank filled. My preacher reminds me of God’s unconditional love for me. I totally get it. God sees me and loves me and wants to give me heaven. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love how my preacher uses the absolute best stories about himself to explain what the Bible really means. I’ve tried other churches in the past, but so many preachers seem to just stick to what the Bible says. That’s so old and irrelevant. I wish everyone would attend my church and they totally can because it’s all virtual! It doesn’t even cost anything: free weekly motivation from a nearly-certified Peloton instructor! </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">2 Timothy 4:1–4     Preach the Word</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.</em></p>

      <title>sheepgoats</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/sheepgoats</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’ He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.” </em>  Matthew 13:24-30</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Jesus teaches us that there will be weeds that grow among the wheat. In the church there are believers and unbelievers. Comparably, Paul says, <em>Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel</em>, (Romans 9:6). And Jesus warns, <em>Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven…&nbsp;</em>(Matthew 7:21).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But it isn't our job to separate the weeds from the wheat. He says let it grow together until the time of harvest. The Bible also says there are sheep and goats (Matthew 25:31-46) and similarly Jesus tells His disciples that He will separate them.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Christ will separate the sheep from the goats. That’s His business; not ours.</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But of course, He does warn us that this will happen. He doesn't keep us in the dark about the tendency some goats have to wander into the sheep pin. So what does the church do with this knowledge? Why, sew sheep-costumes, of course!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As it appears to me,  what we have done, in the name of love, is stood at the door of the church and handed sheep-costumes to the goats. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some might not want to put it on, but we insist. The goats feel uncomfortable in their sheep costume but we do everything we can to make it fit - we soothe their concerns that it isn’t for them with a slick lubricant called Grace, assuring them we all feel that way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At some point we might meet an adult that looks like a goat, but after some light interrogation they tell us someone once gave them a sheep costume when they were 6, but they haven't worn it in years. Rather than discuss true conversion (sheepsayregeneration goatssaywhat), we quickly pick up that old costume and insist they put it back on – once a sheep always a sheep!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But for some reason the uncomfortable ‘sheepgoats’ don't want to worship with us. We ask why. “I don't know. I don't like that music I guess.” So bam, we change it! Problem solved.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are you comfortable now?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I mean, I guess it's better. The music certainly isn't as bad as it was in the 90s, but I don't know…. I just can't pay attention to the sermon. All that scripture, it's so boring; it's all about God, but I don't see what that has to do with me. And why mention that “sin” that's making me so uncomfortable if you say I'm covered by grace? And does God really say I shouldn't do life this way?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Got it! We won't mention sin. He probably doesn't really mean it that way. And we’ll keep the Bible about you. We can do this! Won't you please keep the costume on and come back?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And hooray, they’re back. (Ministry win!) For a little while. But we can tell they’re a flight risk, so we do everything we can to stay relevant to them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Eventually some ‘sheepgoats’ will finally take the costume off and feel so good to be “freed” that they'll tell everyone about it. Which then makes the real sheep wonder if that whole “eternal security” business is legit. The truth is, they know they've heard it, but can't remember where. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>No time to look it up though, I need to pre-read my LifeWay Sunday school lesson</em>. <em>(Love thy neighbor, again?)</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And thus we go on, joining together in irreverent worship with the goats that we listened to just to make sure we were doing it the <strong>right </strong>way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is the right way, right? Better check the numbers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember Christ's words to Peter, “Feed my lambs… Tend my sheep… Feed my sheep.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Let the weeds grow with the wheat. Essentially, ignore it for now. Jesus will sort it out. At the proper time, Jesus will separate the sheep and the goats. You? You feed His sheep. Sheep food.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We should not be at the church door with sheep-costumes, but with a notice: </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">In this place, you <strong>will </strong>be filled with the Word of God. </h4><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Come with an appetite!</h4><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">&nbsp;<em>Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me, but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”</em> - John 10:25–30</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’ - </em>Matthew 7:21-23</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.</em> - Psalm 119:97</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><em>And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. </em>- Deuteronomy 8:3</p>

      <title>The Great Error</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/the-great-error</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” </em></h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I believe I’ve misunderstood <em>The Great Commission</em> all these years. I thought it was about introducing people to Christ and teaching them His ways. And foolishly I thought we were supposed to teach obedience to His ways and even teach others to go and teach these same things. </p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">I see now my great error.</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Obviously the ones who would understand <em>The Great Commission</em> the best are evangelicals themselves, right? Using the example of the most prominent evangelical leaders of the day, let’s break it down and look at what must actually be meant.</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Go - </strong>This is by far the most important command of The Great Commission. Whatever you do, you must “go” and the further you go, the more obedient you are.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Make Disciples - </strong>This is slightly less important than “going” (<em>Go </em>is the first word, after all) and it doesn’t really have much to do with actual discipleship. It really just means to tell people that Jesus loves them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Of All Nations</strong> - This means we need to go everywhere, but we should never try to make “Christian Nations.” The nations themselves must absolutely remain godless, at all cost. It wouldn’t look good for Christ followers to allow Christ’s Lordship to interfere with governments and world systems. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Baptizing them - </strong>This is the key to knowing who your people are and the ultimate goal. <strong>Go </strong>and then <strong>Baptize</strong>. That’s our mission. Now, you can’t control people, so you’ll have be creative here. You want people in that water! There’s really nothing off limits here. The more creative you can be, the more people you’ll win, and the more celebrated you’ll be - on earth and in heaven. </p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And I’m pretty sure that’s the whole of it. Whatever you do, don’t read verse 20.</p><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” </em>(Matthew 28:19–20)</h4><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

      <title>This is How We’ve Always Done It</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/this-is-how-weve-always-done-it</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">…Which isn’t an entirely true statement because assuredly there was a time when “it” was not done that way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But no one can remember such a time and so we go on doing the same things we’ve always done because they were always so and to do otherwise would be to break the tradition that was clearly set in place by super smart, far-sighted people, setting us up for success for generations to come. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So we mustn’t change anything.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The music. You can change the music. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But only if it’s super vague, lyrically, and weak on doctrine. People like to sing about how much God loves them. And we should make it loud enough to elicit an emotional response. Whether people want it or not. People don’t get emotional in church anymore. We should make that happen. Emotions in church are good. Genuine.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The stage. You can change the stage. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It used to be called something else, but we like “stage” better and people feel more relaxed if they feel like they’re at a show. We’ll have to change the seating too - to fit with the whole <em>entertainment</em> theme. We find that it really helps people feel less “bad” about themselves. Something about sitting in pews makes people feel all <em>confessional </em>and that makes people uncomfortable. We don’t want our congregation uncomfortable.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And don’t call them a congregation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The call for repentance. Get rid of it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Since we don’t want anyone feeling bad, we definitely want to avoid any mention of sin. We want everyone here to feel like we think they really are <em>Christian</em> and there is no condemnation for Christians. So technically they can do no wrong. We also don’t need to preach the gospel or give a time of response to people that are already Christians and so, in keeping with the belief that we’re all already Christian, we should leave it out of our services.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everything else, though. We can’t change it. It’s how we’ve always done it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Bible. We should probably slide that in with that discomfort clause.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A lot of the Bible makes people uncomfortable. A whole lot actually. A whole lot of the Bible makes people a whole lot of uncomfortable. Even Jesus talked more about not sinning than he did about making sure people are comfortable. So we’re not sure how we can keep preaching all the things in God’s Word without making people feel uncomfortable. But undoubtedly, <em>Love Thy Neighbor</em> is the super GOAT commandment, so ‘make them comfortable at all costs’ has got to be the way to go. I’m sure we can find something to replace all that uncomfortable Scripture. Funny personal stories always keep them entertained. Besides, everyone wishes they could <em>be </em>the preacher. I mean, at least <em>he </em>has to have some sort of assurance of salvation, right?

      <title>Will You Partner with God?</title>
      <link>/take-me-to-church/will-you-partner-with-god</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What can I say to convince you to partner with God? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I know that the reason people don’t want to become a Christian is just because they don’t know how cool God is. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I know that if I could just get the word out about His awesomeness, everyone would sign the dotted line! What’s not to love?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">God is like the best silent-life-partner. He wants only success for you and He has unlimited resources at His disposal. He has given you power and authority and dominion and wants only the chance to be a co-ruler with you over all that you have.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Whatever <em>you </em>want to do is fascinating to God. Whatever you can dream up, He will help you pursue. He will help you thrive in doing whatever you choose to do. God wants you to Chase Lions. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are free. Free of obstacles. Free of burdens. Free of mundane tasks that don’t fulfill you. You are free to chase your biggest dream. Of course, you might have to hustle though. Everyone does. But don’t take “No” for an answer. God is with you. It is only the world that wants to stop you. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some people are going to try to slow you down by telling you to ask God what He wants you to do, but God wants to know what <em>you </em>want to do. What makes <em>you </em>happy? God is so captivated by <em>your </em>wondrousness that it is His joy and pleasure to walk with you on your chosen path. Whatever big dream you can dream is yours to chase and God’s to follow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why not choose God? His resources are infinite and they are all for you.  Why not start living your best life with God right now?</p><blockquote><h4 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”—yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”  As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. </em>(James 4:13–16)</h4></blockquote>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Sun was bright and hot as it pierced through Jane’s window, slicing across her bed, searing her face. Jane awoke. She didn’t just wake up. Jane was angry to be conscious. Jane was The Cave of Wonders. The Sun was some unworthy seeker disturbing her slumber, wasting her time. The Sun: Jane’s great morning nemesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jane grimaced and moaned and made another mental note to buy curtains. Maybe blinds. She couldn’t decide. Curtains were cheaper and easier to install, but she preferred the simple look of blinds. It was the hundredth time she had made that mental note that summer and was no closer to making a final decision than when she first moved in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Sundays are for sleeping in</em>, Jane insisted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>No; they are not</em>, said the Sun.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jane had nowhere to be and nowhere to go. Unless she was ready to settle the curtains/blinds dilemma, which she was not. She rolled over and buried her face in her pillow, pulling the muslin comforter over her shoulders, savoring those last minutes in her bed. She refused to acknowledge the demands of the Sun. But the brightness begged her to get up, like a nagging mother. Jane remembered all those Sunday mornings growing up when her mother would be just as persistent, just as demanding that she get out of bed, that she get up and get ready for church.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What about church? The thought came to Jane’s mind like a rock falling on her head. It hurt. This was no “Eureka!” moment. She would rather go to the dentist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jane hadn’t been to church in a decade and she had no intention of starting now. What was the point of growing up if it meant you still had to follow someone else’s rules on Sunday? Weekends offered freedom. Jane wasn’t giving that up. Nope. Jane was an adult now and that meant that there was no one around to make her get up. Except the Sun. Why was the Sun so demanding? He’s funny like that.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With a huff, Jane rolled onto her back, throwing her arms down beside her like a miniature temper-tantrum. She watched the fan blades make slow, lazy counter-clockwise laps on the ceiling. Never slowing down, never speeding up, the motion was constant and the breeze was gentle. She recalled her father telling her about a bet between the Sun and the Wind. “I bet I can get that man’s coat off,” said the Wind to the Sun. The Wind blew and blew with all his might, but the harder the Wind blew, the more the man tightened his coat around himself. When the Wind had given up, the Sun came out and shone brightly in the sky. Brighter and brighter the Sun shined until the man removed his jacket, pleased to enjoy the warmth of the Sun.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The Sun always wins, doesn’t he,” she said out loud to no one. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Defeated, Jane got up. <em>Well, at least today I can stay in pajamas.</em>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jane went straight for the coffee. She didn’t need the coffee, or even much care for it, but if she was going to be up with the Sun mocking her through her window, she would at least exploit the situation for a good Instagram post. A decent shot of hot coffee and fuzzy slippers is fine, but it’s the early morning sun that really sells the idea. <em>I’m up with the sun, enjoying coffee and freedom. I’m definitely not lazy; I’m productive. Even when I don’t have to be. Because I adult well.</em>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>But who cares? Being an adult is an illusion anyway. It’s not about how you feel; it’s making yourself do what you should despite how you feel. I just present what I should do as though it’s also what I want to do.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jane’s thoughts were interrupted by the Sun’s condescending rays.&nbsp; It had repositioned itself slightly higher, almost intentionally, as though to remind her that she did not choose to wake up. He woke her up. The Sun had more authority in Jane’s life than she did and they both knew it.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jane grabbed her phone and the coffee that she would make herself drink and left the picture-perfect setting for a darker corner of her house. Really, every corner in Jane’s house was picture-perfect. Everything was staged, ready for an audience. Her personal style was unknown even to herself at this point. Every chair position, every pillow pattern, every plant and picture were all chosen based on how they would look in a post. This wasn’t an obsession, by any means. It was just simply a habit. Jane had been moving things around to get the better shot for so many years that it just made sense for her to decorate that way: for the perfect shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To be fair, this really did work out in Jane’s favor. She was never a “neat-freak.” Far from it. Growing up she washed and cleaned only when she ran out of all other options. Her older sister, Cora, would mock her with a Shel Silverstein poem. “Lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy, lazy Jane,” she would always start whenever their parents complained about the state of Jane’s room or laundry or hair. But now Jane kept things tidy. An advantage of always being picture-ready is that Jane was also company ready, even closet ready when she needed that perfect outfit for a sudden pop-up event. This wasn’t at all Lazy Jane’s nature and she recognized that fact. She was indeed very grateful for the adult-like habit.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The day continued to be just as lazy and indecisive as that morning. Jane roamed around her house like a forgotten playground ball slowly rolling around an empty yard at the urging of the wind. This was normal on Sundays, but the summer sun was adding hours to this ritual. All the extra time was causing Jane to think too much. She wandered and wondered. Wondered and wandered. Jane thought about her friends, her job, her house. She thought about all the photos she shares online and then she contemplated the word <em>share</em>. What does it really mean? Jane was sharing her life with the world, and yet sharing it with no one at all. There was no one to sit and chat with in the perfectly positioned chairs. No one there to drink the mandatory coffee with her. No one there to share her thoughts with, or better yet, to keep her from having them. The emptiness of Jane’s life haunted her on Sundays.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every other day of the week Jane had plenty to do. Work, friends, shopping. She didn’t have to think about her life those days. Those days she just lived it. Jane’s weeks were filled with empty routines and mundane tasks. Full enough to keep her from thinking. But Sundays there was nothing. Nothing but Jane, the Sun, and her thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The next Sunday morning Jane was on her side, her back intentionally to the window. As much as she pretended the Sun wasn’t there, she knew he was, tapping her shoulder, insisting she get up for another day together. Just the two of them. What would they think about today? Would they recount all the mistakes Jane had made in her life? There was enough material from Fourth Grade alone to fill the day. Jane turned and squinted at the Sun. “Should we start there?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No. Jane decided she would not spend the day feeling sorry for herself. She wanted a break. She was desperate, and desperate times call for desperate measures. Jane started the shower and sent her sister a text.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<strong>Hey – think I'll come to church today.”</strong></p>
