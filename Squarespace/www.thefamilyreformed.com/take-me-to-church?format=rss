James 1:12, the crown of life, also in Revelation 2:10. 1 Peter 5:4 tells us of the crown of glory. But what most people don’t realize is that there is another crown not mentioned; it is the Loophole Crown.</p><p class="">The Loophole Crown is given when believers find loopholes in the Law. It is through these loopholes that Christians, although appearing to be disobedient to Christ, actually stay within the Law because of some clever technicality.</p><p class="">Obviously, this is a special crown for only the most cunning of Christians, but if you have an especially crafty Christian guide, he could help you find and follow the loopholes to ensure your very own crown.</p><p class="">This technique requires the Christian to pay very close attention to the Law. Every jot and tittle. I know what you’re thinking: isn’t that Legalism?</p><p class="">Well, it’s only Legalism when your focus is on the Letter of the Law with the intention of being too strict. Focusing on the Letter of the Law to find ways out of the Law, with total disregard for the spirit of the Law, is not only well within our Christian rights, it’s rewarded.</p><p class="">Everyone knows their favorite child is the one that pushes the boundaries and squirms out of responsibility. The favorite employee is always the slimiest one - finding all the ways to do anything but what they were hired to do. This is surely how God feels about the Loophole Believer! He’s likely super impressed with all the work they don’t do, with all the guidelines they don’t follow, with all the examples they don’t set. </p><p class="">So while other believers may hear, “Well done, my good and faithful servant” these Loophole Believers will get the very coveted <em>High-Five </em>and be called “Bruh” when given their crown. Not to mention, this crown is one you get to keep while everyone else is casting their crowns before the throne.</p><h4><em>Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. </em><strong><em>Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven</em></strong><em>, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. </em>(Matthew 5:17–19)</h4>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HELLO.

My name is Christian. I am not really sure what that means, but I was given this name tag at the door. I keep trying to get an answer, but no one can tell me.</p><p class="">I guess we’re supposed to listen to the guy on stage, but I don’t think he knows either. Maybe I missed it.</p><p class="">It looks like everyone has the same badge, so really I don’t see any reason to wear it. Except that I heard someone say that it’s the only way into heaven.</p><p class="">I think it’s supposed to make us different somehow. But I guess that doesn’t happen until we die. </p><p class="">I have lots of name badges just like mine to give away to other people, too. I think there is a reward system based on how many people you can get to wear the  “Christian” badge. I still haven’t found where to redeem my rewards yet. Just add that to the list of unknowns. I feel like such a newb, but I’ve been here all my life.</p><p class="">Each week we get together for music and coffee and we talk about how hard life is. Then we hear an uplifting “message” from the man on stage and that seems to get us through the week. But the fuel doesn’t last long, because everyone is back with more complaints the next week. I guess the plan is to keep getting together each week to share our struggles until we finally die and then everything is fine because we’ll be in heaven. </p><p class="">Heaven is supposed to be pretty great. There’s this guy there named “God.” Well, I think he’s there. I guess it’s like his house. I mean, it makes no difference to me who he is. I guess it’s better than the other place.</p><p class="">I think he’s supposed to be a father figure or something. (A bit of an absent dad if you ask me.) I’m supposed to tell people about him. Oh, and his son. But no one is really telling me anything about the guy, so I’m pretty clueless about what to say. </p><p class="">Most of the songs we sing are about him, but I haven’t learned much there either. He loves me. He loves me. Oh, he loves me.</p><p class="">I guess that’s all we need to say about the man, right? </p><p class="">Every once in a while I feel like I want to know more about God, but whenever I try to start a conversation about him everyone acts like I’m their 10th grade teacher showing up to a party with a pop quiz. I think the trick is to stop asking questions and just sing.</p><h4><em>Pray then like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.</em> (Matthew 6:9)</h4>

I thought it was about introducing people to Christ and teaching them His ways. And foolishly I thought we were supposed to teach obedience to His ways and even teach others to go and teach these same things. </p><h4>I see now my great error.</h4><p class="">Obviously the ones who would understand <em>The Great Commission</em> the best are evangelicals themselves, right? Using the example of the most prominent evangelical leaders of the day, let’s break it down and look at what must actually be meant.</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>Go - </strong>This is by far the most important command of The Great Commission. Whatever you do, you must “go” and the further you go, the more obedient you are.</p><p class=""><strong>Make Disciples - </strong>This is slightly less important than “going” (<em>Go </em>is the first word, after all) and it doesn’t really have much to do with actual discipleship. It really just means to tell people that Jesus loves them.</p><p class=""><strong>Of All Nations</strong> - This means we need to go everywhere, but we should never try to make “Christian Nations.” The nations themselves must absolutely remain godless, at all cost. It wouldn’t look good for Christ followers to allow Christ’s Lordship to interfere with governments and world systems. </p><p class=""><strong>Baptizing them - </strong>This is the key to knowing who your people are and the ultimate goal. <strong>Go </strong>and then <strong>Baptize</strong>. That’s our mission. Now, you can’t control people, so you’ll have be creative here. You want people in that water! There’s really nothing off limits here. The more creative you can be, the more people you’ll win, and the more celebrated you’ll be - on earth and in heaven. </p></blockquote><p class="">And I’m pretty sure that’s the whole of it. Whatever you do, don’t read verse 20.</p><h4><em>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” </em>(Matthew 28:19–20)</h4><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It’s Spa Day!</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 12:29:29 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/take-me-to-church/its-spa-day</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:618de9f5a2a6b36c7ab97da8:61ece1d3a71f774ff5ecede9</guid><description><![CDATA[It's Spa Day!

The work week is so full of worries and troubles and people making you feel like you can't do anything right.  But Spadays - I mean Sundays - are the days I get fed. And because it's God's house, I even get “holy daycare.” There are so many people that just love taking care of me and my kids. That's not really my thing. </p><p class="">I need my church to be a place where I can come and not worry about my kids or have any responsibilities. I just need to be poured into. I just need assurance that I'm loved just the way I am. I just need fellowship with other women. I need a place to vent about my husband. </p><p class="">Since my husband doesn't come with us anyway, I'm actually thinking about going to the divorced women’s fellowship group that's starting next month. It’s called “Un-Tied” and their theme verse is Galatians 5:1. Most of my friends will be in there. They are really a great source of comfort to me. They know of all sorts of resources on living your best life. </p><p class="">Sometimes I wish my church offered more for me, but I'm always a little disappointed when they make announcements because it seems like they're always just requests for volunteers. But that's definitely my only complaint. I keep dropping hints that we need more fun stuff, so I'm still hopeful. Not just for me, I'm not being selfish! It would be great if the kids had more things too. And what parent wouldn't want more “holy daycare”? </p><p class="">I'm always thinking of great ideas like that. I sort of have a knack for knowing what people want.

What’s not to love?</p><p class="">God is like the best silent-life-partner. He wants only success for you and He has unlimited resources at His disposal. He has given you power and authority and dominion and wants only the chance to be a co-ruler with you over all that you have.</p><p class="">Whatever <em>you </em>want to do is fascinating to God. Whatever you can dream up, He will help you pursue. He will help you thrive in doing whatever you choose to do. God wants you to Chase Lions. </p><p class="">You are free. Free of obstacles. Free of burdens. Free of mundane tasks that don’t fulfill you. You are free to chase your biggest dream. Of course, you might have to hustle though. Everyone does. But don’t take “No” for an answer. God is with you. It is only the world that wants to stop you. </p><p class="">Some people are going to try to slow you down by telling you to ask God what He wants you to do, but God wants to know what <em>you </em>want to do. What makes <em>you </em>happy? God is so captivated by <em>your </em>wondrousness that it is His joy and pleasure to walk with you on your chosen path.

Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”  As it is, you boast in your arrogance.

You can change the music. </p><p class="">But only if it’s super vague, lyrically, and weak on doctrine. People like to sing about how much God loves them. And we should make it loud enough to elicit an emotional response. Whether people want it or not. People don’t get emotional in church anymore. We should make that happen. Emotions in church are good. Genuine.</p><p class="">The stage. You can change the stage. </p><p class="">It used to be called something else, but we like “stage” better and people feel more relaxed if they feel like they’re at a show. We’ll have to change the seating too - to fit with the whole <em>entertainment</em> theme. We find that it really helps people feel less “bad” about themselves. Something about sitting in pews makes people feel all <em>confessional </em>and that makes people uncomfortable. We don’t want our congregation uncomfortable.</p><p class="">And don’t call them a congregation.</p><p class="">The call for repentance. Get rid of it.</p><p class="">Since we don’t want anyone feeling bad, we definitely want to avoid any mention of sin. We want everyone here to feel like we think they really are <em>Christian</em> and there is no condemnation for Christians. So technically they can do no wrong. We also don’t need to preach the gospel or give a time of response to people that are already Christians and so, in keeping with the belief that we’re all already Christian, we should leave it out of our services.</p><p class="">Everything else, though. We can’t change it. It’s how we’ve always done it.</p><p class="">The Bible. We should probably slide that in with that discomfort clause.</p><p class="">A lot of the Bible makes people uncomfortable. A whole lot actually. A whole lot of the Bible makes people a whole lot of uncomfortable. Even Jesus talked more about not sinning than he did about making sure people are comfortable. So we’re not sure how we can keep preaching all the things in God’s Word without making people feel uncomfortable. But undoubtedly, <em>Love Thy Neighbor</em> is the super GOAT commandment, so ‘make them comfortable at all costs’ has got to be the way to go. I’m sure we can find something to replace all that uncomfortable Scripture. Funny personal stories always keep them entertained. Besides, everyone wishes they could <em>be </em>the preacher. I mean, at least <em>he </em>has to have some sort of assurance of salvation, right? I bet that’s a nice thing to have.</p><p class="">Now don’t change any of these things; it’s the way we’ve always done it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Sunday Santa Satire</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/take-me-to-church/a-sunday-santa-satire</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:618de9f5a2a6b36c7ab97da8:61ac4a83bc911907f2242e47</guid><description><![CDATA[Can anything be hidden from God?]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Sunday School Teacher: “Okay class, Can anything be hidden from God?”</p><p class="">Children: “Noooooooo!”</p><p class="">Sunday School Teacher: “That’s right.

Nothing ever came from the pulpits other than frightful warnings of hell and sin and eternal damnation. </p><p class="">Church discipline, they say, actually happened. When members of the congregation claimed Christianity but lived contrary to it, the preacher, it is rumored, called that person out on his behavior.</p><p class="">Now I have never in my life met such a preacher. But everyone knows of them. They were so bad that the stench of their intolerance still lingers in most churches today. </p><p class="">Christians don’t need Hell and Brimfire preaching, do we? All that does is turn people away from Christ, right? After all, we are saved by grace. There is no condemnation for Christians. Right? So if there is no condemnation, then surely there is no longer sin. And if there is no longer sin, then we need to only hear of God’s grace.</p><p class="">Grace. That’s what we want. Give us grace. We don’t need to hear about anything we might be doing wrong. We want grace.</p><p class="">We want grace like the Israelites in the wilderness wanted meat, and I’m afraid that’s what we’re getting. </p><p class=""><em>And say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat. You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’</em> (Numbers 11:18–20)</p><p class="">………………………………………….</p><p class=""><em>Then a wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground. And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague. Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving. </em>(Numbers 11:31–34)</p><p class="">Surely we’re making ourselves sick. We live lives so full of undisciplined abounding grace, that there isn't a trace of holy sanctification left among us. There is more Fruit of the Spirit found in your disciplined Buddhist neighbor than there is in a whole congregation sometimes.</p><p class="">And would we have it any other way? I suppose we are no different from the Israelites.

I think he has a few more life-coach type classes, but I am confident he will be certified in no time. He’s a natural encourager and coach and you really feel that in his sermons. </p><p class="">From him I have learned that these are times for loving my neighbors. I am naturally so in-tune with what might be offensive that it is practically my super-power, so I’ve got loving my neighbors covered. That’s great because that’s like God’s only rule. Since I can follow that rule without even trying I can focus entirely on myself. Having time to focus on me is absolutely necessary because I’m kind of a hot mess. I often feel like I am alone and facing constant struggles and I'm tempted to blame myself and look for things I need to change, but my preacher helps me see that I’m actually doing everything right. I was perfectly made. It’s just that I live in a fallen world and Satan is constantly in my ear telling me I shouldn’t do this or that. Not only that, but sometimes God <strong>needs </strong>me to fight Goliath. So life is hard. </p><p class="">Every week I feel completely beat up and unloved by the same world that I am so good at loving. All of my relationships have been struggles and none have lasted. Why is everyone so selfish? Even though I make sure to tell him what my love language is, I have yet to meet a man that will love me enough to<em> love me</em> the way I want to be loved. </p><p class="">Sunday mornings are when I get my love tank filled. My preacher reminds me of God’s unconditional love for me. I totally get it. God sees me and loves me and wants to give me heaven. </p><p class="">I love how my preacher uses the absolute best stories about himself to explain what the Bible really means. I’ve tried other churches in the past, but so many preachers seem to just stick to what the Bible says. That’s so old and irrelevant. I wish everyone would attend my church and they totally can because it’s all virtual! It doesn’t even cost anything: free weekly motivation from a nearly-certified Peloton instructor! </p><p class="">2 Timothy 4:1–4     Preach the Word</p><p class=""><em>I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>sheepgoats</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/take-me-to-church/sheepgoats</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:618de9f5a2a6b36c7ab97da8:618deb47d884a24a27b68d6e</guid><description><![CDATA[… As it appears to me, what we have done, in the name of love, is stood at

So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’ He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.” </em>  Matthew 13:24-30</h4><p class="">&nbsp;Jesus teaches us that there will be weeds that grow among the wheat. In the church there are believers and unbelievers. Comparably, Paul says, <em>Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel</em>, (Romans 9:6). And Jesus warns, <em>Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven…&nbsp;</em>(Matthew 7:21).</p><p class="">But it isn't our job to separate the weeds from the wheat. He says let it grow together until the time of harvest. The Bible also says there are sheep and goats (Matthew 25:31-46) and similarly Jesus tells His disciples that He will separate them.</p><h4>Christ will separate the sheep from the goats. That’s His business; not ours.</h4><p class="">But of course, He does warn us that this will happen. He doesn't keep us in the dark about the tendency some goats have to wander into the sheep pin. So what does the church do with this knowledge? Why, sew sheep-costumes, of course!</p><p class="">As it appears to me,  what we have done, in the name of love, is stood at the door of the church and handed sheep-costumes to the goats. </p><p class="">Some might not want to put it on, but we insist. The goats feel uncomfortable in their sheep costume but we do everything we can to make it fit - we soothe their concerns that it isn’t for them with a slick lubricant called Grace, assuring them we all feel that way.</p><p class="">At some point we might meet an adult that looks like a goat, but after some light interrogation they tell us someone once gave them a sheep costume when they were 6, but they haven't worn it in years. Rather than discuss true conversion (sheepsayregeneration goatssaywhat), we quickly pick up that old costume and insist they put it back on – once a sheep always a sheep!</p><p class="">But for some reason the uncomfortable ‘sheepgoats’ don't want to worship with us. We ask why. “I don't know. I don't like that music I guess.” So bam, we change it! Problem solved.</p><p class="">“Are you comfortable now?”</p><p class="">“I mean, I guess it's better. The music certainly isn't as bad as it was in the 90s, but I don't know…. I just can't pay attention to the sermon. All that scripture, it's so boring; it's all about God, but I don't see what that has to do with me. And why mention that “sin” that's making me so uncomfortable if you say I'm covered by grace? And does God really say I shouldn't do life this way?”</p><p class="">“Got it! We won't mention sin. He probably doesn't really mean it that way. And we’ll keep the Bible about you. We can do this! Won't you please keep the costume on and come back?”</p><p class="">And hooray, they’re back. (Ministry win!) For a little while. But we can tell they’re a flight risk, so we do everything we can to stay relevant to them. </p><p class="">Eventually some ‘sheepgoats’ will finally take the costume off and feel so good to be “freed” that they'll tell everyone about it. Which then makes the real sheep wonder if that whole “eternal security” business is legit. The truth is, they know they've heard it, but can't remember where. </p><p class=""><em>No time to look it up though, I need to pre-read my LifeWay Sunday school lesson</em>. <em>(Love thy neighbor, again?)</em></p><p class="">And thus we go on, joining together in irreverent worship with the goats that we listened to just to make sure we were doing it the <strong>right </strong>way.</p><p class="">This is the right way, right? Better check the numbers.</p><p class="">Remember Christ's words to Peter, “Feed my lambs… Tend my sheep… Feed my sheep.”</p><p class=""><em>Let the weeds grow with the wheat. Essentially, ignore it for now. Jesus will sort it out. At the proper time, Jesus will separate the sheep and the goats. You? You feed His sheep. Sheep food.</em></p><p class="">We should not be at the church door with sheep-costumes, but with a notice: </p><h4>In this place, you <strong>will </strong>be filled with the Word of God. </h4><h4>Come with an appetite!</h4><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">&nbsp;<em>Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me, but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”</em> - John 10:25–30</p><p class=""><em>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’ - </em>Matthew 7:21-23</p><p class=""><em>Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.</em> - Psalm 119:97</p><p class=""><em>And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. </em>- Deuteronomy 8:3</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
