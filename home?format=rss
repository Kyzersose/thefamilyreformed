Growing up in Southern Baptist churches, this wasn’t something I often

There are no new revelations to be had. Deuteronomy 4:2 says, “You shall 
not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep 
the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.” And Revelation 
22:18, “I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: 
if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this 
book.”]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. (Exodus 20:7)</em></span></h4><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">I often wonder how much we pay attention to the Ten Commandments. Do Christian parents still teach them to their children? Are they memorized or even familiar in Christian homes. Is this one of those things we’re assuming our kids learn in church and so it is absent in the home? I’m sure the answers vary across families and churches, but I would like to encourage parents to go ahead and take on the task of teaching their own children the Ten Commandments!</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The first four teach us our God-given responsibilities to Him. The last six teach us our responsibilities to each other. Because the last six are about how we ourselves are to be treated, we tend to be quicker to enforce the keeping of these commandments. I want my children to honor me, I do not want to be killed, I do not want my husband to commit adultery, I do not want my stuff stolen, I don’t want people telling lies about me, and I suppose I really don’t want someone bitter because of something I have. These are actually so important to us as a society that we even have laws enforcing several. And truly, how much better would life on earth be if every pagan and Christian alike would adhere to these commandments. These are important.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The first four, though: these commandments seemed to have fallen by the wayside. We are not very concerned with our behavior toward God. “Love your neighbor” - absolutely! But that is second to loving God! And how do we love God? Jesus tells us in John 14:15, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments.”</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">We should love God more than our neighbor! Yes, even more than our spouse and our own children. We must keep things in the right order. And I assure you, loving God more will only serve our neighbor better. They will not be abandoned.</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. (1 John 5:2–3)</em></span></h4><p class="">So now that we’re prioritizing God, let’s look at the first four commandments and get back to my radical idea!</p><p class="">It’s absolutely worth studying and understanding all four of the first commandments and learning what proper application looks like in our time and place in history. Today, let me dive into the third one: <span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"><em>You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. (Exodus 20:7)</em></span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">My understanding of this was that we should never say “Oh my G**.” That’s a rule I grew up with and that’s the rule my kids are still under. We have even gone so far as to deem it the worst of the bad words! I tell them that we need to be more aware of how we speak of God. Even if “God” isn’t His name, we cannot speak of Him flippantly - without regard or reverence. That would be “in vain.” I also want to impress upon them the priority of God in our lives; His name in vain is the worst of the worst!</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">But that’s pretty basic and I don’t believe it fully covers the third commandment.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Consider the statement, “God told me…” I’ve noticed more and more people saying it these days. It seems to come with some sort of holy confidence. Growing up in Southern Baptist churches, this wasn’t something I often heard, but it was becoming common in my adulthood, and I wanted in on it. There was certainly a desire to know God’s direction for my own life as a young wife and mother, and TWICE I lead a women’s group through a study called “Discerning the Voice of God.” In hindsight, I wish someone would have slapped me in the face with a Bible! It’s all there - in the Bible! There are no new revelations to be had. </span>Deuteronomy 4:2 says, “You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.” And Revelation 22:18, “I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.” </p><p class="">“Listen more than you pray” was what I learned from that study and, “Listen more than you pray” was what I repeated to others! Again - someone go back and slap me with a Bible, please! Instead of looking for divine answers from a voice in my head, I should have been reading God’s Word with the intention of knowing Him. The difference in my life, then versus now, reading versus “listening,” is profound. It’s the difference between confusion and confident direction. Then I “listened” but had no idea what God wanted me to do. Now I have his direction, His promises, and His purpose for me, all in black and white.</p><p class="">When we say, “God told me…” I think what we often mean to express is the Holy Spirit’s work in our lives. He indeed is God and He indeed does teach us (John 14:26) and gives us understanding through God’s Word. But we are warned to discern the spirits and that must be done through a knowledge of God and Truth and that is through His Word.</p><p class="">So here’s a radical idea: Use reverence and careful consideration before you attribute something to God!</p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">For one, every time we say, “God told me…” we are potentially positioning God to be a liar. In fact we are then the liars. Consider all the times God has supposedly told someone they were going to do something and it didn’t happen. Did God lie?</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. (Proverbs 30:5–6)</em></span></h4><p class="">For two, it keeps us from searching the Scriptures. Christians are not taught the sufficiency of scripture and that is a great tragedy! Instead, we are taught to close our eyes and listen, Bibles closed in our laps. If we really knew how relevant God’s Word is to every aspect of our lives, we <em>would</em> read it and be able to make informed decisions based on what God really <em>did</em> say. The Holy Spirit gives us understanding through His Word. </p><p class="">Pray. Read your Bible. Be counseled by the Holy Spirit. And do not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Radical Ideas: Why We Quit Sunday School</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 20:56:33 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/radical-ideas-why-we-quit-sunday-school</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:65bd1fd34f852505ff0922bb</guid><description><![CDATA[When I was growing up, I used to play this game with my family called 
“Balderdash.” I hope someone reading this knows the game! It was very 
simple and very fun. Basically, one player read an obscure word and the 
other players wrote made-up definitions for that word. Then, the first 
player read all the definitions, including the real one and everyone voted 
on what they thought was the true definition. You’d get points for any 
guesses on your made-up definition.

It’s such a fun memory - it was fun to be clever and trick people into 
thinking your definition was legitimate. It was even more fun to just go 
for the laughs - not writing a definition that would get votes, but one 
that would make everyone laugh. I’ll always take the hit if I can make you 
laugh!

How is this my first point? Because adult Small Groups are almost exactly 
like this game! Maybe I should rephrase my initial statement: Adult small 
groups are Balderdash!]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><em>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. (James 3:1)</em></h4><p class="">I was raised in church, so from probably birth through my thirties I attended Sunday School. Likewise, my children have all been raised going to Children’s Church and Sunday School classes. I think now we call them <em>Small Groups</em>. </p><p class="">The emphasis on small groups was so strong in our old church that we even had a “Culture Statement” that “Church happens in circles, not rows.” I realized later that this statement comes from Andy Stanley’s teaching, and it really pains me how much his false teachings have infiltrated modern beliefs. Although I am sure they don’t originate from him; I think he just has a knack for tying up worldly philosophies in a neat churchy package. Of course the point here is not to start a list of false teachings in the church, but to acknowledge how tightly church culture has gripped <em>small groups</em>, and to point out that it’s perhaps time to loosen our grip.</p><p class="">I will concede that one can state a number of good reasons to have small groups, both for adults and for children, but those good things can’t be a barrier to assessing if it’s something that we <em>should</em> do. Let’s take on children’s small groups first.</p><p class="">In a traditional church environment, at least what I grew up in, children attend Sunday School classes with kids their own age, then go to church with their parents. We called that “big church.” There is also Children’s Church for some of the younger children offered during the time of the sermon. What I am seeing more and more of in both the mini-mall type churches popping up as well as the mega-church model is Sunday School for everyone up through youth happening at the same time as the actual church service. So families are at the church for about an hour: babies in nurseries, children with their group, youth with theirs, while parents attend the service. Then adult small groups are encouraged “off-campus.” Of course there are variations.</p><p class="">The idea is to get together with people your own age and learn in a way most beneficial for that age. There’s nothing wrong with that motivation and I am not attacking those desiring to teach young hearts about God. It’s just that sometimes we need to look at the results of our actions and determine how we should continue.</p><p class="">The results: We are separating generations and taking faith out of the home. </p><p class="">I remember hearing warnings about the necessity of teaching Christ at home to your children and I wasn’t sure what to do with that. Obviously we should do that. Why wouldn’t we? But the warnings were coming from the evidence that Christ was not being taught adequately at home. With the exception of church on Sundays and prayer at dinner, the typical Christian parent operates as a passive Christian model, letting the church take the active role in teaching.</p><p class="">I specifically remember giving the same warning to parents: “Do not rely on the church be the primary teacher of your children.” But even then I did not know the solution, because I didn’t see the root of the problem. Churches originally took on the teaching role to offer additional support to the home, but over time, that support became the singular pillar of Biblical instruction to children. If we knock that pillar down, it all crashes. Most now see children’s Sunday School as the sole mechanism for discipleship and even salvation for our children! But as a result of that…</p><p class=""> 1.) Children are catered to and learn to worship in a way that pleases them. This continues as they get older and by the time they are in youth groups, they are practically attending a different church altogether. Statistically, once they go to college, they won’t come back. A Barna Group study claims that 75% of kids raised in church won’t return after high school. And my experience says that most of those that do return look for the church with the best concert experience. Doctrine be damned.</p><p class="">2.) Children are learning from people that are not likely qualified. This is a huge theme overarching the Sunday School crisis (<strong>see James 3:1</strong>) and we will dive more into it when we cover adults. But for now, consider the fact that the biggest qualifier for a Sunday School teacher is someone that will say “Yes.” </p><p class="">3.) Children from Sunday School grow up to be parents that don’t know any different. This was not always the way. Fathers led their families once and now we struggle to understand what that means.  The best we can do is allow the father to decide what’s for dinner and THAT’S usually a sacrifice- some submissive act to brag about in our women’s group! How often does it occur to even the most faithful church-goer to have the father of the house lead the family in Bible study and worship each night? The lack of biblical-leading fathers allows for total complacency with weak doctrine taught in churches in the first place because there is no tangible reason for more meat, for solid food, when dads are under no obligation to lead in a practical way.</p><p class="">This last point is the most detrimental and beautiful to me. Detrimental because families relying on the church for household discipleship is a pandemic among God’s people. Perhaps a significant number of those children falling away from the faith should be attributed to a lack of family discipleship. But, acknowledging what we have forgotten is the first step to getting on the right path. Fathers that assume the role of Spiritual Leader of their family - leading them in family worship, discipling his children, washing his wife in the Word- they will demand more. They will not be complacent. They will seek out proper edification and they will pass their faith to the next generation. They will share their faith with their children and grand-children. The idea of simply singing the same songs to worship God as generations before me as well as after me is one of the most beautiful things I can imagine.</p><p class="sqsrte-small"><em>A note to wives here: desire for your husband to be properly edified at church. Choosing a church based on music style or social groups should not be a top priority for your family. A family whose father is growing in knowledge in grace will produce generational fruit!</em></p><p class="">And now for the adults. Adult small groups are garbage.</p><p class="">Okay, maybe that’s harsh. And certainly not all-inclusive. But hear me out. I have two points:</p><p class="">1.) When I was growing up, I used to play this  game with my family called “Balderdash.” I hope someone reading this knows the game! It was very simple and very fun. Basically, one player read an obscure word and the other players wrote made-up definitions for that word. Then, the first player read all the definitions, including the real one and everyone voted on what they thought was the true definition. You’d get points for any guesses on your made-up definition.</p><p class="">It’s such a fun memory - it was fun to be clever and trick people into thinking your definition was legitimate. It was even more fun to just go for the laughs - not writing a definition that would get votes, but one that would make everyone laugh. I’ll always take the hit if I can make you laugh!</p><p class="">How is this my first point? Because adult Small Groups are almost exactly like this game! Maybe I should rephrase my initial statement: Adult small groups are Balderdash!</p><p class="">I am a huge proponent of discussions, and I absolutely believe that iron sharpens iron, but unless your deep-diving, Bible-dissecting small group is being lead by a someone who is basically a trained pastor, called by God, your group is just playing Balderdash with the Bible. And even worse than that! We walk away giving the correct interpretation the same value as the wrong ones! As a result, we go on with life with this idea that the very interpretation of God’s Word is up for grabs, choosing how obedience to simple commandments work best for our lives, our families, our time. Under this model, we undervalue the authority of Scripture ad the role of pastors. This leads me to the second point.</p><p class="">2.) What in the world are we paying our pastor for? The role of pastor has completely shifted away from a shepherd called by God to lead His flock, to something more like a CEO that went to seminary. As a matter of fact, the role of pastor is so undervalued that we believe that anyone with a desire to learn must be called by God (often against the man’s will) and anyone with a desire to preach is called by God (according to the man’s own will). The man we want to pay to lead the church is the one who will grow the numbers. On Sunday mornings we listen to sermons designed to appease the masses and then we’re told that if we want to go deeper we should join a small group, where we circle back to discussions with unqualified leaders with no authority.</p><p class="">This model is a disaster. We require nothing from the pulpit but TED Talks and laughs. We have forgotten that it is God who calls, not man, and that the position is a high calling, not to be taken lightly. Losing the standard for the role of Pastor will continue to have calamitous effects on the body of Christ.</p><h4><em>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. (Ephesians 4:11–14)</em></h4><p class="">So here’s a radical idea! Instead of everyone going their own way every Sunday morning, stay together! Learn together! Find a pastor that will teach all of God’s Word accurately and then bring what you learn into your home -  teaching your own children all week long. Rinse and Repeat :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Watch Out!</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 22:43:53 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/watch-out</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:65944c4e4ede061723e97c6d</guid><description><![CDATA[I want to learn from my mistakes.

I am beyond grateful to those who have guided me away from cliffs and out of danger. And I cannot, in any good conscience, turn a blind eye to others struggling. This is the primary motivation for this whole blog!</p><p class="">Ezekiel 33:6 says, <span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">“But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.”</span></p><p class="">Although I am clearly not Israel’s watchman, I have never been able to ignore the implications of this verse. How can I see danger coming and not warn, especially those I love?</p><blockquote><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul. (Ezekiel 33:7–9)</em></span></p></blockquote><p class="">Have we been given a word from the mouth of God? Absolutely!</p><p class="">There must be a foundational, absolute, truth that is used to show the way. God’s Word. It isn’t the watcher’s guess or opinion given as a warning to the people; it is from the Lord, absolutely omniscient and absolutely good.</p><p class="">Consider what an amazing time it is to live right now with the complete Word of God always at our finger tips. We are not Israel relying on the prophets. We have been given more. We are not 1st Century Christians with limited access to the Scriptures and teachings of the apostles. We have been given more. We are not Christians in the Middle Ages without translations in our own language. We have been given more! And yet so many Christians continue to walk such rocky, dangerous paths without any real regard for the Word of God.</p><p class="">Why?</p><p class="">Again, here I go…. What is the cause for shallow, clumsy Christian lives in such a rich time of resources? We not only have the <em>very</em> sufficient Scriptures, we have the experiences and teachings of those who have faithfully lived and studied and preached the Word of God. What is our excuse? Why do we turn a blind eye to the innumerable warnings along the path? Why do so many Christians seem to be so complacent?</p><p class="">Why sin, of course! More specifically, though, I think that it is the modern church’s <em>perspective</em> of sin that is causing calamity in the lives of believers. We seem to be mostly okay with it. Mostly okay with Sin.</p><p class="">Sadly, I have heard many friends and even family members make comments regarding sin like, “You can’t escape it, so why try,” or “God doesn’t care about the little things.” This attitude regarding sin and God is simply not biblical and is truly detrimental.  <em>(Even the hairs on your head are numbered, Luke 12:7. Because you are lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth, Revelation 3:16. The complacency of fools destroys them, Proverbs 1:32. Put to death therefore what is earthly in you, Colossians 3:17.)</em></p><p class="">Surely our whole lives are the sum of “little things.” When we ignore God in the little things, we ignore God in most of our life. Likewise, when we consider God in the little things, we consider God in most of our lives. And if we ignore the sin in the little things of life, we ignore most of the sin in our lives.</p><p class="">Let’s correct our view of sin. It is first and foremost right and good to know that the punishment of sin is death and to know that Christ has redeemed His people - He has paid the debt for believers’ sin and through Him we can live eternally. Let us praise God and truly have peace with this knowledge. But let our understanding of sin not die at the cross also. The effects of sin are still felt on this side of death. Sin brings destruction in our lives. It destroys our relationships with our families, our friends, our church and strains our relationship with God. The very nature of sin is against God and therefore every act of sin is against God’s perfect design for life.</p><p class="">The modern American church has a very weak view of sin. Most preachers do not properly warn believers of the harm sin produces in a Christian’s life. And once again, I am asking, “Why?” Why aren’t we warned? Why are we no longer exhorted to put to death the sin in our lives in a way that compels us to act? And again the answer must be sin. We like it. It’s comfortable. People who tell us not to sin make us uncomfortable. Sermons that call us to a life of repentance are unpopular.  And even when we hear the truth, sin itself blinds us to the warnings! Sin deceives - even believers.</p><p class="">Sin’s deception is the reason we must take an active role in the mortification of our sin. Passively, we will be complacent. We will get cozy and comfortable with the sin in our lives and not realize the danger coming. We will set our children up for pain and destruction in their lives as we raise them. We will be ineffective in discipling one another, failing to guide others along the right path and keep them from stumbling. From falling. From strife. From divorce. From drunkenness. From disobedience. From destruction. From sin.</p><blockquote><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>The Call of Wisdom</em></span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice; at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: “How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you. Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded, because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof, I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you, when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me. Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD, would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof, therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices. For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them; but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.” (Proverbs 1:20–33)</em></span></p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Method of Bible Study</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 15:47:54 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/a-method-of-bible-study</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:6400aa63f6338978858ad16d</guid><description><![CDATA[I think Christians go through steps of Bible study in their walk.

I remember a time in my walk when I was convinced that all things happened for the lost, that God sustained all of life for the sake of even one more soul won for Him. It seems altruistic, right? To take ourselves out of the equation and put all of our efforts into saving the lost. But when we do this, our focus, although it’s not on ourselves, is still not on God. </p><p class="">I remember reading the beginning of Andy Stanley’s book, Irresistible, and he talked about some young girl who had just learned of Christ and was so overwhelmed with joy, but then she asked the fateful question: why isn’t everyone a Christian? The news was so good to her and she didn’t understand why anyone would not be happy to hear of Christ and then accept him eagerly. </p><p class="">This book was being passed around and praised in our church and I couldn’t get past the introduction! Sinners’ hearts are not inclined toward God! The whole premise of the book and the subsequent doctrine it taught was based on a denial of that fundamental truth.</p><p class="">When we turn our ears and our hearts to the lost, we are suddenly at the mercy of a people that hate God. We want to reconcile unbelievers to God on their terms, which makes reading the Bible very difficult, much less preaching it. We want so badly to save the lost that we turn our backs on the very God we are trying to save them for.  Suddenly we are turning less and less to God’s word for how to do things and instead we are asking what the current culture wants. We are preaching acceptance and love, instead of sin and repentance, and literally “unhitching” from the word of God.</p><p class="">Personal Bible study with a heart focused on convincing unbelievers of God’s goodness makes us squirm through most of the Bible. They wouldn’t like what it says here, here, and here! We become apologetic and avoid most of what God has to say.</p><p class="">Now this brings us to another problem: how do we hear from God when we won’t read His Word? Now we are relying on a God who speaks directly to us, and I suppose the more confidently and frequently we can say “God told me…” the holier we are. And, if you’re very charismatic, or at least very convincing, this is a great way to start a cult. ;)</p><p class="">We have to outgrow these Bible study methods! It is a shame to see so many adult Christians stuck here. It is a tragedy to see so many preachers stuck here -in either of these two mindsets!</p><p class="">Instead, look to study God’s Word with the objective of knowing God. When we do that, we will easily see that God loves. He loves His people. He knows us individually, intimately: knitting us in the womb and knowing even the number of hairs on our head! He finds His sheep, and not one will be lost. I say those first because we don’t have to feel like turning our focus toward God means we are turning our back on the lost or ourselves. It is much better to let God direct our way to reach the lost than it is to try to figure it out on our own. It is much better to learn how we should live by faith through the direction of God’s word than it is to go by how we <em>feel</em> we should live. God takes care of us better than we can take care of ourselves.  </p><p class="">When we study God’s Word to know Him, with the belief that He is good and just and all-knowing, we will not be ashamed or apologetic of what we read. We will not make excuses or compromise His commands to appease others. We will not make life-altering decisions based on one verse taken out of context. Rather, we will learn to apply the whole counsel of God to our lives. We will be driven daily to His Word to know him more. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Family Reformed: Basics</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 16:51:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/the-family-reformed-basics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:62a76b2557916a1aab5d4af0</guid><description><![CDATA[Think of Christianity as a cast-iron skillet.

It's pretty solid, nearly unbreakable, and lasts a life-time. More than that, actually! It passes down through generations. I still cook with my grandfather’s cast-iron skillet.  But how many of us have gotten out that skillet to find that we had put it away without drying it fully? Take that heavy, indestructible, far superior skillet and add something that seems as pure and harmless as water to it and it really won’t take long to find it’s starting to rust.  </p><p class="">Our Christian churches and Christian families are built on beliefs that are solid, but we are not impervious to faulty thinking. We are not incorruptible. Seemingly harmless world-views and philosophies get in and quickly start to corrupt our Christian beliefs and practice. Like rust on an iron skillet. Sometimes this can go on until what was once worthy of passing on to children and grand-children now looks like garbage and they want nothing to do with it.  </p><p class="">So the best thing about cast iron? You can clean it up! Even the rustiest skillets can be restored and made to look like new! “Reforming”  is like restoring. It’s like getting a metal scrub pad and cleaning off the rust. I love how indestructible cast iron is, and Christianity is even more than that. But our churches and our families often require de-rusting and re-seasoning.&nbsp;Let’s get scrubbing!</p><h3>&nbsp;<strong>Reformed Family Basics</strong></h3><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><h4>Read to know God.</h4><p class="">The first thing you want to do is read your Bible. But don’t just read to check that box. And, at least for now, don’t read to find personal application in every verse. Don’t read it as a meaningless history book. </p><p class="">Man's chief end, our purpose, is to glorify God. So start by reading your Bible to know God. Learn who He is from His own Word. Knowing who God is allows us to rightly practice our belief in Him. This brings Him glory and honor and praise. Sloppy, lazy, anything-goes Christianity only works to diminish God’s reputation. We become something more like a barrier to His glory rather than a demonstration of it.</p><p class="">Start in Genesis. What’s the first thing you learn about God? Straight up – God is Creator.</p><p class=""> Now keep reading with that perspective: God is Creator. </p><p class="">Who are you, o man? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. </p><p class="">To fear the Lord is to place Him properly and place ourselves accordingly. Don't read God’s Word through the lens of what you already know or how you feel. Let what you read become the lens through which everything else is understood. Keep reading, always asking&nbsp;God to give you a correct picture of Himself, destroying any false images we have made.</p></li><li><h4>&nbsp;Submit to the authority of God's Word</h4><p class="">As you continue to read God’s Word, submit yourself, your marriage, and your parenting to the instruction of the Lord – clearly given to us in Scripture. Know your role. Let Scripture define your responsibilities and boundaries, and prayerfully submit to them. Know that God gave us instruction for our good. The Creator of heaven and earth, church and family, knows the design and gave us the manual. Follow it! </p><p class="">There is a quote I love from a character in a C.S. Lewis book – “There are a dozen views about everything until you know the answer. Then there's never more than one.”</p><p class=""> There’s only one true interpretation of Scripture, and yes – we are fallen, so we certainly are capable of misinterpreting. I don't think that should allow us to make excuses. God’s Word was not written exclusively to theologians to decipher and decode for the layman. It's pretty straightforward for the most part. The Holy Spirit enables us to understand, illumines various texts at various times, and equips us to live obedient to the Word. </p><p class="">I am skeptical of people that make excuses for differing interpretations. Especially when it allows for a wide open, to-each-their-own mentality. It's like saying <em>any combination of numbers will work to open a combination lock, as long as you turn right, turn left one full rotation, turn right.</em> The motion might be correct, but nothing clicked in place. But the reality is, once the truth clicks in place, it's silly to give it the same weight as any other viewpoint. The right interpretation is in fact the right interpretation.</p><p class="">When you know the truth, submit to it. Don’t make excuses, but ask for God’s strength and guidance. Living biblically is absolutely going against the current. You will feel resistance. But God’s grace is sufficient to keep us going, and even flourish in obedience.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p></li><li><h4>Family Worship&nbsp;</h4><p class="">What is the Great Commission? To make disciples - teaching  them to obey Jesus’ commands. Funny how this seems to be the greatest motivator for mass evangelism while true discipleship has been forgotten. There is a push in the church to get parents to serve everywhere but in their own home and everyone but their own family. At the surface, this push to serve not only seems harmless, but noble and right. We should serve, right? And my goodness, we need volunteers, don’t we!</p><p class="">We have countless programs and activities in place to offer some resemblance of discipleship to our children. These children’s programs have been elevated to the status of necessary for true discipleship. </p><p class="">I believe, though, that what many are failing to see is that these programs remove children from proper discipleship and instead offer a watered-down, chaotic, hour-long substitution. We’ve become satisfied, nay, we praise this sort of “discipleship” and have forsaken intentional, daily teaching in our homes. </p><p class="">And what has been the result? The need for more programs, of course! Because each generation of undiscipled children is actually growing - the reverse of what should be happening. We must return to family worship!</p><p class="">What does that look like? It’s a simple as fathers reading and discussing God’s Word with their families. It’s praying and singing together. Put the burden of Sunday School back on the father’s shoulder. Church should be supplemental, not primary. </p><p class="">Christian parents have forgotten that their most important job on this earth, for this time, is to disciple their children. Don’t just get your children to accept Christ, teach them to follow Him! Teach them all he has commanded us. This is THE job. It isn’t something that should be diminished and outsourced.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p></li><li><h4>Join a Bible Believing / Bible Preaching Church&nbsp;</h4><p class="">Church cannot and should not replace Family Worship. But neither can Family Worship replace Church! Belonging to a church is necessary for all believers. It is necessary for strengthening individuals, families, communities, and the world! We must join with the body of believers to worship God and build each other up.</p><p class="">The current trend in churches is to be a church for the lost. If you’re not lost, don’t go to that church! It’s not for you! Go to a church that elevates God above man - <em>even lost man</em>. Go to a church that has a stated <em>and practiced</em> commitment to worshipping God. This does not mean that the lost will fall by the wayside - God knows how to find the lost. The lost don’t know how to find themselves. How can we let what appeals to the lost determine our liturgy? Instead, the church should strengthen and equip believers for evangelism in their daily lives and discipleship in their homes.  </p><p class="">Join a church that recognizes the authority of Scripture. In the same way that parents should submit to the authority of Scripture in their lives, so should church leaders submit to that same authority. What good is a church or church leader that will compromise on Scripture? Suddenly there is no authority, no standard, no playbook. Eventually every command will be gray and obeyed at the discretion of individual feelings.</p><p class="">If your pastor is preaching from what seems like an abridged version of the Bible, you'll end up carrying the load God ordained pastors to carry. Fathers will struggle to find the time to both provide for their family and  study God’s Word with the zeal and depth that God called pastors to do. Mothers will feel lost and unsupported in raising children in a biblical, counter-cultural way. A good church equips believers with sound doctrine which is useful for healthy marriages, for raising fruitful children, and for proper evangelism in the believers’ daily walk. </p></li><li><h4>Persevere&nbsp;</h4><p class="">This is a life-long endeavor and it is absolutely worth the effort. </p><p class="">Our natural tendency is to fill our time with the wrong things. Are the demands of life worth forsaking the spiritual health of our family? Every day is a new day with new mercies, a new opportunity to read the Bible with your spouse and with your children. It’s never too late to begin. Or begin again. Again.</p><p class="">Stay in the Word and in prayer and in church and keep running the race. Fight the good fight and keep the rust off the skillet.</p></li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parenting through the Old Testament</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 22:25:58 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/parenting-through-the-old-testament</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:61f707da0ae2f14bc690411c</guid><description><![CDATA[I recently read through the Old Testament for an Old Testament Survey

As I read, I started to notice a pattern of how God dealt with His people as the books progress. It’s as though there is this parallel that you can draw between the age of your child and the page in the Bible. You can look at how God deals with His people in each book of the Old Testament and know a little better how to parent a child of the corresponding age.</p><h4><strong>The Law (The Very Early Years)</strong></h4><p class=""><strong>Genesis</strong>: Creation - You’ve created a life. You haven’t given your sweet baby any rules; you’re just spending time with them, loving them. As they get a little older, you give them boundaries, but there’s still plenty of leniency. This is also when, as a parent, you notice that things just don't go the way you hoped they would. It’s okay to be flexible in your style and try new things.</p><p class=""><strong>Exodus</strong>: They’re still pretty young and at this point you really don’t know who the slave is and who’s the master! Just expect lots of disobedience and utilize the time out (call it exile); it’s good for you both! This is a very good time to lay out some basic family rules. (See the 10 Commandments)</p><p class=""><strong>Leviticus</strong>: They’re getting old enough to have friends outside their family and they start to notice what everyone else is doing. So now you have to remind them that your family isn’t like everyone else and you find it necessary to make up crazy, gross rules that you never imagined you’d need! Your kids need to know that your standard is different from the world’s.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Numbers</strong>: You start realizing how many kids you got and how much that costs!</p><p class=""><strong>Deuteronomy</strong>: They are getting older, but still preschoolers and a little older. As much as they drive you crazy, spend time with your kids. It is so important to tell your kids more about God than the world tells them about anything and at this age they give you those opportunities because they are so curious. Everything is “Why?” All you have to do is be there for the questions (when they wake up, when they lie down, and as you walk through the day) and remember that every answer can get you back to God.</p><h4><strong>The History Books (The Elementary Years)</strong></h4><p class="">Start teaching them some bigger life-lessons:</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>Joshua</strong>: Be strong and courageous to seek and do God's will.</p><p class=""><strong>Judges</strong>: God uses the weak and the strong; be willing.</p><p class=""><strong>Ruth</strong>: God generates faith in unexpected people.</p><p class=""><strong>1 &amp; 2 Samue</strong>l: Learn from the mistakes of others.</p><p class=""><strong>1 &amp; 2 Kings</strong>: Even the good guys aren’t perfect.</p><p class=""><strong>1 &amp; 2 Chronicles</strong>: Instill in your children a love of history.</p></blockquote><p class=""><strong>Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther</strong>: They’re getting even older and your kids should have more personal responsibilities now. They play a role in the family and there’s work to be done!</p><h4><strong>Poetry (The Teenage Years)</strong></h4><p class=""><strong>Job</strong>: We really know this is for teenagers; his life was literally the worst!</p><p class=""><strong>Psalms</strong>: Luckily, we have the psalms for parents and teenagers alike to help us all cope during this trying time.</p><p class=""><strong>Proverbs</strong>: They’re not out of the house yet and there are still lessons to be learned! What kind of man/woman is this child going to be? Saturate them with wisdom.</p><p class=""><strong>Ecclesiastes</strong>: Your soon-to-be-adult children are probably starting to look everywhere for meaning. But perspective is key. Both they and you need to remember that if they aren’t seeking God’s will, everything is in vain. Help them put God’s will above their own. Be sure not to get your own will in the way either.</p><p class=""><strong>Song of Solomon</strong>: Don’t stir up love until the appropriate time. Honestly, is there any reason to have a boyfriend/girlfriend before you’re old enough to marry? Encourage them to protect their heart and save all that for the right time. A much later time!</p><h4><strong>Prophets (The Young Adults)&nbsp;</strong></h4><p class="">They’re about to leave the house. Things are going to get real. Consequences are real. You’re not going to be there to bail them out. Now’s the time for those last warnings and then there’s really nothing left for you to say. In a sense, you’re kind of done. It might seem like you’re in for 400 years of silence, but rest in the Lord. Jesus has it from here.</p><p class=""><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Laugh to the Glory of God</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 03:59:11 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/laugh-to-the-glory-of-god</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:61da588815fd6901d121e5da</guid><description><![CDATA[Our daughter’s baby book had a little place to write in something like “Our

And he did it again and again and again until she married him.” </p><p class="">And really, that pretty much sums it up. Our friendship was built on laughter, and our marriage has thrived with laughter, and laughter continues to fuel our entire family. Obviously, God is at the center of our family, but I can’t help but acknowledge the <em>gift </em>that laughter has been in our lives.</p><p class="">I believe that’s what laughter is, a gift from God.&nbsp; But not just a gift. It’s a tool.</p><p class="">Laughter is a great tool for building, for mending, and for strengthening relationships. </p><p class="">When I first came on staff at our church, we had a staff retreat. It was a time for edification and for building relationships, but I was nervous and uneasy. It was great training in a gorgeous environment, but, for me, what made it a ‘retreat’ came at those last hours of the day when we were all around the table laughing together, long after the meal was done. </p><p class="">One of the most precious times we can appreciate the gift of laughter is in the midst of our most painful times. A friend that can make us laugh in the middle of that pain offers us a temporary relief. It’s a glimpse of joy in the darkest hour, and a reminder that one day there will be no sorrow.</p><p class="">In the Psalms we see God laughing, but He is laughing at the enemies. In His laughter, He reminds us to have faith in the midst of fear.</p><p class="">But I believe that this joyous gift from God, this powerful tool, has become a powerful weapon – perverted and used against God’s creation.</p><h4>Why are we laughing?</h4><p class="">Consider childhood. We’re all familiar with kids ridiculing and teasing someone and I think we can all sympathize with the pain of being laughed at, even if we haven’t experienced it ourselves. Some might even still carry the burden of being the instigator of that laughter.</p><p class="">Consider comedy. Not too long ago, my husband and I were watching a comedian and about halfway into the show she started making jokes about her abortion. At least half the audience was laughing with her and all I could think was, “How did we get here?”</p><p class="">Then I had a bit of an epiphany this past summer while I was chaperoning kids’ camp. </p><p class="">The total number of campers that week was significantly smaller than it probably should have been, and as a result of that, the already small auditorium wasn’t even half full. During the morning worship rallies they would play these videos that were supposed to be funny but I didn’t hear any of the kids laughing. What I did hear was all of the staffers sitting strategically placed throughout the groups OVERLY reacting and laughing at the videos. Whether those staffers realized it or not, they were being used as a tool to train the children to laugh at something that had no <em>truly </em>humorous quality. </p><p class="">Sitting in that auditorium with all the fake laughs of course reminded me of TV laugh tracks. It occurred to me how manipulative they are. The laugh tracks <em>tell </em>us, and our children, how we are supposed to respond to things. So when a TV dad is a bumbling idiot, we really should be sad for that family.  But the laugh track tells us it’s hilarious indeed. </p><p class="">I now see how anything once viewed as clearly contrary to God’s commands can be normalized, embraced, and celebrated, <strong>even by God’s own people</strong>, through the powerful tool of laughter, and I absolutely believe that we can and should be mindful to protect this precious gift and use laughter to the glory of God.</p><h4><em>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. </em> (1 Corinthians 10:31)</h4>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When a Fish is a Fish</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 16:03:49 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/when-a-fish-is-a-fish</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:61ce6be76439d959befd325b</guid><description><![CDATA[A mentor of mine would often ask, “How does a goldfish glorify God?”

We get to see glimpses of our infinitely intelligent creator when we observe His creation functioning as it was designed. (At best we can merely observe such intelligence, and then we pat ourselves on the back with such pride just for noticing. But let’s save that for another day!)</p><p class="">The goldfish glorifies God by being a goldfish. God created a goldfish to be a goldfish and we can observe the beauty and wonder of that cute little thing swimming contentedly in it’s bowl, back and forth. If the fish for one moment decided it wanted to be a dog, it might jump out of the water but would struggle for breath and never get even the slightest “bark” in.</p><p class="">A fish that tries to be a dog does not glorify God. It defies God. And it dies. </p><p class="">And then there are some that might even have the audacity to ask, “How could God let such a thing happen?”</p><p class="">We live and breathe thanks to God’s design, but we were created for more than life in the sense that a goldfish has life. We were uniquely made in God’s image and with a purpose.</p><p class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”</em></span></p><p class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	So God created man in his own image,</em></span></p><p class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	in the image of God he created him;</em></span></p><p class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>	male and female he created them.</em></span></p><p class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” (Genesis 1:26–28)</em></span></p><p class="">All things are made for God’s own glory. But in our rebellion, we seek our own glory and buck against God’s design; we think we know better than God. </p><p class="">~A fish that begs to be a dog does not have God’s own glory in mind.~ </p><p class="">We have to acknowledge our tendency to go against God, because when we ignore it, we convince ourselves that God wants us to be something that we were never designed to be. It is something we must guard our hearts against, but for many generations we have not.</p><p class="">The unguarded passivity of most American Christians through the last few generations has passed on a legacy of great confusion. God’s design for male and female has been covered over and buried deep in mantras of: “You can be whatever you want to be,” “Whatever makes you happy,” and the like. </p><p class="">Aren’t these really the same messages we want to hear from God? And so rather than consider if our fallen nature has altered our perspective of what is in fact <em>good</em>, we instead become the <em>better </em>parent by insisting our children decide what is best for themselves. We then throw whatever resources we have at the dream and call it sacrificial parenting.</p><p class="">Fallen man loves himself the most and “self-love” becomes justified when we transpose it onto our children. It is a noble thing to work more to have a nicer house… for your kids.</p><p class="">So Christian parents with unguarded hearts have stolen the truth of God’s design and exchanged it for the lie that in fact, your heart is <em>not </em>deceitful and should actually be followed.</p><p class="">The result is that now most churches are filled with confused congregations looking for ways to feel better about themselves. They are Christian fish, trying to be dogs, gasping for air, and praying the remedy makes them better dogs. Their life is faithless. <a href="https://femina.libsyn.com">Nancy Wilson</a> once said something like, “Faith agrees with God.” Let that sink in. </p><h4>Faith agrees with God.</h4><p class="">A faithful congregation comes to the Word of God with open ears and open hearts, itching to learn how their creator says to live, wanting to identify every lie they believed that led them down a path away from God.

Part of biblical womanhood and manhood involves passing on these truths to the next generation. Passivity is not an option.

Christmas songs offer a timely example - we giggle about “gay happy meetings” and panic at the “ox and ass” at the manger. </p><p class="">Sometimes the meaning of a word stays the same, but the whole concept around it changes. Something that starts as <em>unacceptable </em>is eventually embraced. The reverse is also true; we see something once <em>appropriate </em>become offensive.</p><p class="">I believe this is the case with the word “jealous.” </p><p class="">When we think of jealousy, we often think of controlling, abusive men that must be avoided. Just think of how this plays out on The Bachelorette - all these men want to have a “relationship” with the one girl, and if something real actually seems to be there, the man can only bite his tongue and put his emotions aside, lest he get ridiculed for not playing nice. “That one isn’t sharing!”</p><p class="">Even worse - if he shows the slightest bit of disapproval over another man being affectionate toward the same girl that he was just also being affectionate with, flags are thrown, alarms go off, and the villain music plays. He must go. And the internet must destroy him. </p><p class="">Now in my opinion, dating-before-marriage needs to go all together, but that’s another post - so I’m not going to get into the sheer ridiculousness of The Bachelor/ette (which at least used to be pretty entertaining - like Jane Goodall watching the gorillas - don’t judge!)</p><p class="">But it needs to be noted - culturally, we have absolutely demonized “jealousy.” </p><p class="">How then can anyone in our society come to the Word of God and read of God’s jealousy without knee-jerk repulsion?</p><h4><em>For you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is </em><strong><em>Jealous</em></strong><em>, is a </em><strong><em>jealous </em></strong><em>God. (</em>Exodus 34:14)</h4><h4><em>For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a </em><strong><em>jealous </em></strong><em>God. </em>(Deuteronomy 4:24)</h4><p class="">How can we reconcile God’s jealousy? Is God wrong to be jealous?</p><p class="">Before we answer (although the answer is obviously “No!”), let’s also consider what Paul tells the Corinthians:</p><h4><em>For I feel a </em><strong><em>divine jealousy</em></strong><em> for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. </em>(2 Corinthians 11:2)</h4><p class="">Paul also experiences jealousy, and he isn’t apologizing for it. On the contrary, he is shaming the congregation for their behavior. </p><p class="">It seems to be that jealousy is an emotion that we are not only allowed to have but is actually a godly virtue. God’s jealousy is an indicator that something is <em>terribly wrong</em>. Not once will we be in the right to shake our finger at God. “tsk, tsk, tsk… You better get a handle on that!”</p><p class="">Likewise, when Paul speaks of his jealousy, it is an emotional reaction to something <em>terribly wrong</em>. The solution is not for Paul to get a grip, but for the Corinthians to get a clue. Their behavior needs to change.</p><p class="">When we spark God’s jealousy, it is because we are giving something that belongs to Him to someone or something else. God is right to be jealous. He is the creator and sustainer of all life. He is our protector and our provider. When we look elsewhere for those things, He is right to be jealous. When we give our attention to other things, He is right to be jealous. When we worship other things, making sacrifices for them, making time for them, making plans for other things without regard to God, He is right to be jealous. And how much more do we stir His jealousy when we call ourselves His People?</p><p class="">The language God uses is strong - His people are whores and prostitutes (see Hosea and Ezekiel, among others). It’s strong language for a reason. It should offend us. It should trip us up. Knock us down. It is meant to get our attention and get us back on track.</p><p class="">Are we paying attention?</p><p class="">Paul took on the role of shepherd to many flocks. He knew that discipleship was much more than evangelism. If you were part of a congregation that Paul had influence over, he made sure he was not neglecting his responsibility of bringing you to Christian maturity.</p><h4><em>Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me. </em>(Colossians 1:28-29)</h4><p class="">If God has given us dominion or stewardship over a people, we should absolutely be jealous when we see them straying. What God has given you, you have a right to be jealous for. Husbands <em>should </em>be jealous for their wives’ time and attention. Parents <em>should </em>be jealous for their child’s attention in training and instruction. Pastors <em>should </em>be jealous for their congregation’s ear. </p><p class="">Paul was jealous when the Corinthians were being influenced by false apostles. They were being led away from devotion to Christ. He likened them to a bride betrothed, turning to another man (2 Corinthians 11:1-4). It’s disgusting and heart-breaking, but we miss the imagery and barely recognize the fault of the Corinthians because we have villainized <strong>jealousy</strong>.</p><p class="">Sinners absolutely corrupt things: not all jealousy is divine. However, when we feel jealousy our first thought should <em>not </em>be that we need to work on ourselves, but to assess the situation. Is something amiss? Is there a responsibility that God has given me that I am neglecting? Is someone under my watch being lured away?</p><p class="">If we aren’t feeling jealousy at all, we might need to ask ourselves if we’ve bought into the lie that we have no claim on what God has given us! Have you desensitized yourself to the barometer of jealousy?</p><p class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>2 Corinthians 11:1–4</em></span></p><p class="sqsrte-small"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me! For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough.</em></span></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Truth and Love</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 21:25:17 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/truth-and-love</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:619bece40cb4ae606f816920</guid><description><![CDATA[We have a tendency in church culture to put truth and love on opposite

Therefore, love actually functions as a muzzle to truth.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">We have a tendency in modern Christian culture to put <em>truth </em>and <em>love </em>on opposite sides of a pendulum. If we swing over to the truth side, then we tend to feel we are somehow being unloving. If we go over to the love side, then we feel we aren’t able to tell people the truth. </p><p class="">The truth can often seem to be offensive, and <em>offensive </em>typically means <em>unloving</em>, right? So the thinking here is that if we are to tell someone the truth, we must limit it in a way as to not offend them. In this way, <em>love </em>actually functions as a muzzle to <em>truth</em>.</p><p class="">Is this right? Play this out in your head for a minute: you don’t want someone to get upset so you don’t say anything that upsets them. How far does that get you with your children? It certainly shouldn’t be your aim to upset your children, but any parent knows that trying to raise a child without ever upsetting them absolutely <em>spoils</em> their character. </p><p class="">Now apply this same logic with believers, whether children growing in faithful homes or adult believers growing in Christ. If we hold back the truth because we fear hurt feelings, then we will stunt their spiritual growth and inevitably <em>spoil</em> their Christian character. </p><p class="">I wish I could hand you a glass of spoiled milk right now. Imagine taking a huge gulp of spoiled milk. I feel like it’s worth the mental picture because the physical response we have over drinking spoiled milk should pale in comparison to our own distaste of spoiled believers. The standard in discipleship should be much higher. We should desire the truth, even when the truth makes us uncomfortable. We are most loved by those who will tell us the truth.</p><blockquote><p class=""> <span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. (</em>Ephesians 4:11–16)</span></p></blockquote><p class="">Paul says to speak truth <em>in </em>love. Truth and love should never fall opposite of each other. If they did, that would put <em>love </em>on the same side of the pendulum as <em>lies</em>,<em> </em>and <em>truth </em>over there with <em>hate</em>. </p><p class="">If we are holding back on the truth of God’s Word, we <strong>cannot </strong>say that it is because of love. It isn’t <em>love </em>to want someone’s spiritual growth stunted. It shows neither love for God nor love for the person. Preachers must preach God’s Word, parents must teach it, and friends must share it. We must not think that pointing out wrong beliefs or false teachers is unloving. Surely we should desire the truth for ourselves and for others - for the spiritual growth of the whole church and the benefit of generations to come. We will indeed stunt our growth if we forsake a truth hard to hear for comfort.</p><h4>Love should not be the inhibitor of truth, but the motivation for telling the truth.</h4><p class="">Think of truth as a ship, taking you closer and closer to God. Love, then, is the fuel that makes the vessel go. Love is fuel - not brakes - there are no brakes on a boat! Without the motivation of love, you speak less truth. You won’t go very far and, as Paul says, we become tossed to and fro by false doctrines, human cunning, and deceitful schemes. If a preacher in a church is holding back on the Word of God, he should expect his congregation to follow any charismatic leader or new philosophy and they’ll never know the difference. </p><p class="">Likewise, parents must teach their children all of God’s Word. Discuss it, apply it, and correct them as they grow. They are on this vessel with you for now, but it is your goal to get them to steer their own vessel. No loving parent wants a shipwrecked child. In love, teach them the truth. Teach them how to love their own children by speaking truth, never separating <em>truth </em>and <em>love</em>.</p><h4><em>Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. </em>Ephesians 4:25</h4><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Conviction Over Compromise</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 17:51:06 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/conviction-over-compromise</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:618a99ea8cb56b570a1d3bdd</guid><description><![CDATA[One could easily argue that without conviction there would be no

Martin Luther famously said:</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason… I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p class="">Martin Luther was on the chopping block for his convictions, and he could have selfishly put them aside and lived a much more peaceful life. <strong>This is true of all reformers.</strong> Through reading God’s Word, the Holy Spirit illuminates God’s way, and therefore, man’s error. Once God’s way is known in a man’s conscience, he has two options: obey or compromise.</p><p class="">A foundational truth must be understood to move forward: </p><h4>Fear of God produces conviction. Fear of man produces compromise. </h4><p class="">When we do not have a fairly good grasp on what God actually says, we are much more prone to compromise on what we think He says. In the days of the reformers, most people knew God’s Word second hand through clergy, teachers, and tradition. This is not unlike our biblical knowledge today. Most of what we believe the Bible says comes from what we have learned from preachers, Bible study teachers, and traditions.  The real tragedy today is that this is still true even though we have more access to the Bible than ever before. </p><p class="">It is when we study for <strong>ourselves</strong> what the Bible says that we will grow bold enough to stand on our convictions and begin reforming our own homes to be godly homes as Scripture defines. The more we study, the more we will recognize the philosophies that have become strongholds in our thinking and decision making.</p><h4><em>We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ </em></h4><h4>2 Corinthians 10:5</h4><p class="">Every decision we make is based off of some philosophy or belief system that has taken root in our decision making process. As we read Scripture, we should be allowing time to consider what philosophies we believe that relate to the passage. Does our thinking fall in line with God’s Word or does our thinking conflict with His Word? Likewise, as we go through the day, we will hear various thoughts and viewpoints. Before we let those views become our views, we must weigh them against the truth of the Bible. Do we then accept the view or reject it? This is a constant process. </p><p class="">I believe this process is a place where we will find that maturing Christians will do quite a bit of repenting. An action is something done. We may regret an action and it is relatively easy to say that we have repented of it - we just don’t do it again. However, personal philosophies are at the root of most actions. Actions that lead to regret or require repentance often mean that we have believed something that is in conflict with God. It is here that we must recognize our tendency to adopt worldly thinking. As we begin to sift through our thoughts we will see more and more how much we have compromised on being obedient to God.</p><p class="">Repent. Turn away from world philosophies. Do not let the world’s wisdom in your house. Make decisions for your family based on God’s wisdom and instruction. This is reformation!</p><h4><em>See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.  For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. </em></h4><h4>Colossians 2:8–10</h4>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Change of Heart</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 14:24:29 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/a-starting-point</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:6172c7c928833e0e5d69b44e</guid><description><![CDATA[I never liked kids.

Maybe 1, but that was doubtful. </p><p class="">God is the God who changes hearts. </p><h4><em>And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you.

A small child started following me. He was only watching the legs at his eye level and so he thought he was following his mother. I knew that when he looked up, he was going to freak out and my thought process was something like, “He’s going to scream; people are going to look; people are going to think I am trying to kidnap this kid!” Rather than try to find the mother or dismantle the kid-bomb I knew was about to explode, I stopped moving, threw my hands in the air, and started assuring everyone that I wasn’t trying to steal the kid. “He’s not mine!” Everyone, including the kid, looked at me like I was crazy. Luckily, my friend was more nurturing. She calmly laughed and talked to the young lad and quickly found his mother. She had been following right behind him, waiting for him to notice that he had mindlessly followed a crazy stranger.</p><p class="">Around the same time, I was actually watching a friend’s toddler during the day. I wanted to help her out, but I really didn’t like the whole kid-watching gig. One day I was complaining to my sister over the phone about it, trying to come up with a way to get out of my commitment. Her recommendation was that I pray and ask God to change my heart. I was so furious at this answer! I didn’t want my heart to change; I wanted my circumstance to change! I was so angry that I hung up on her. I’m pretty sure this was a phone you could slam down to hang up; at least, that’s how I remember it!</p><p class="">But now here I am - a church preschool minister with a passion for godly, fruitful families.</p><p class="">God is the God who changes hearts.</p><h4><em>Let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be given to him; and let seven periods of time pass over him. </em>Daniel 4:16</h4><p class="">I don’t know why, but God changed my heart. I say that I don’t know why because I never asked Him to. But every day I am so unbelievably grateful because whatever His plan is has something to do with me or my kids  - because He changed my heart against my own stubborn will! </p><p class="">Who am I that I should benefit from His plan? I am chief of the sinners and least of the saints. I look around and I see that He isn’t doing that for everyone. </p><p class="">Who am I? </p><p class="">He has given so many others over to their lust and desires, but He changed my heart. </p><h4><em>And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. </em>Deuteronomy 30:6</h4><p class="">I love my God and I will seek His will and serve Him with very little regard for man’s wisdom because I know that man’s ways lead to destruction, and I know that He pulled me off that path without my asking. I see the goodness of God’s ways and I see the folly of my own.</p><p class="">I can’t change anyone’s heart and hearing what I have to say from time to time might make you want to slam a phone in my ear to shut me up, but I pray that God does change your heart and that you too will get to taste and see that the Lord – and His ways – are good!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>“But what do you DO?”</title><dc:creator>Sarah Shaeffer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thefamilyreformed.com/home/but-what-do-you-do</link><guid isPermaLink="false">616a2b96d2cc753c6b131644:616a2c5fc50ff5640a60bf25:616ae609aeefa1346b34e691</guid><description><![CDATA[I was once asked what I did - what my job was. “I’m a wife and mother.”

The question was essentially,  “What do you do, as in for work…. as in, for <em>worth</em>.”</p><p class="">The role of ‘wife and mother’ has been so devalued in our culture, that neither wife nor mother is apparently a job that actually needs to be done anymore; it’s just a bunch of tasks that can be outsourced. We love to outsource things, don’t we! Anything that can be done by someone else, well, I suppose it should, right? Anything mundane can be taken care of by a robot or a drive-thru and anything requiring skill or patience is really best left to the “experts.” </p><p class="">Teachers teach. Preachers preach. Doctors diagnose.</p><p class="">Over the last (nearly) century, we have really seen a shift from “jack of all trades” to “that’s not in my wheelhouse.” We once had the “village” to help moms overcome the knowledge gaps: how do I correct this, teach that, cook this, and diagnose that? We just don’t have that anymore. It seems like it should be easier to have a village because of how easily we can connect through technology, but the wisdom has been forgotten. Trying to do for yourself what the masses have outsourced is generally perceived as foolishness and you’ll likely get more ridicule than help.</p><p class="">One Christmas, my kids and husband had the flu. (Not mom – moms don’t get the flu!) We didn’t go to the doctor. We recognized the symptoms, monitored the fevers and insisted on plenty of fluids. “But how do you know it’s the flu?” people would ask. It was as though I wasn’t allowed to give a diagnosis or treatment without a doctor’s consent. </p><p class="">“Who gave you the authority to <em>not </em>go to the doctor?” </p><p class="">I am not at all saying doctors are bad or should be avoided, but I am saying we have crossed a line in outsourcing nearly all matters of home and family. For all the knowledge and information we have at our fingertips, I am amazed at how it only seems to count if it is a specialized knowledge, proven by a paycheck.</p><p class="">Check your heart on this one. It’s not just that mothers can do the things we’ve been outsourcing, it’s that we should! ‘Wife and Mother’ is a wonderful, God-given job! This calling is the rule, not the exception. Even the Christian family has gotten this one backwards. Most moms now think staying home is a special call, when in fact, we should be treating working outside the home as a special call. God has specifically chosen you to be the mother to your own children, the wife to your own husband. The decision to work outside the home, requiring the education and the care of the household to be outsourced, should be made with the same care and concern as a missionary would make before moving overseas. It should be prayerfully considered and confirmed by the husband and church.</p><h4><em>The&nbsp;heart&nbsp;is&nbsp;deceitful&nbsp;above&nbsp;all&nbsp;things, and&nbsp;desperately&nbsp;sick; who&nbsp;can&nbsp;understand&nbsp;it? </em>Jeremiah 17:9</h4>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
